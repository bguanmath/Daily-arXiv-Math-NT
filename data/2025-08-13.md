Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $H(2,1;\underline{t})$ be Hamiltonian superalgebras over $\mathbb{F}$, an
algebraically closed field of prime characteristic $p>3$, which are
non-restricted simple Lie superalgebras, generally. In this paper, we study
generalized $\chi$-reduced simple modules over $H(2,1;\underline{t})$. We
proved that all generalized $\chi$-reduced Kac modules of
$H(2,1;\underline{t})$ are simple with $p$-characters $\chi$ of height 0.
Additionally, the isomorphism classes of these simple
$H(2,1;\underline{t})$-modules are classified and their dimensions are
determined.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda relating formal degrees of
square-integrable representations to adjoint gamma factors for symplectic and
even orthogonal groups over characteristic zero non-Archimedean local fields.
The proof is based on the twisted endoscopic characterization of the local
Langlands correspondence for such groups and extends an approach already
appearing in the original paper of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda itself inspired from
earlier work of Shahidi. Namely, the argument consists in computing in two
different ways a residue of certain standard intertwining operators suitably
extended to a large representation realized on an explicit space of functions.
This gives rise to the spectral decomposition of certain singular twisted
orbital integrals. The main theorem follows from a comparison of this identity
with the Plancherel formula of a symplectic or even orthogonal group. The proof
can be adapted to deal with other classical groups, namely odd orthogonal and
unitary groups, but the formal degree conjecture was already established in
these cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We extend the notion of generalized Whittaker models by allowing them to be
built upon smooth irreducible representations of unipotent subgroups of a
$p$-adic reductive group that are not necessarily characters, nor induced from
Weil representations. This notion generalizes the usual notion of generalized
Whittaker models, which include the Bessel and Fourier--Jacobi models. Using
Kirillov's orbit method for unipotent groups, we define and prove basic
properties of the corresponding Jacquet functors. We also provide new instances
of generalized Whittaker models of multiplicity one.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We first define a class of non-weight modules over the N=1
Heisenberg-Virasoro superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$, which are reducible modules.
  Then we give all submodules of such modules, and present the corresponding
irreducible quotient modules which were exactly studied in \cite{DL}. Also, we
prove that those modules constitute a complete classification of
$U(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules of rank $2$ over $\mathfrak{g}$, where
$\mathfrak{h}=\C L_{0}\oplus\C H_{0}$ is the degree-0 part of $\mathfrak{g}$.
As an application, we obtain a class of weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules from
those non-weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules by weighting functor. Furthermore, we
study the non-weight modules over the four subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$: (i)
the Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra; (ii) the Neveu-Schwarz algebra; (iii) the
Fermion-Virasoro algebra; (iv) the Heisenberg-Clifford superalgebra. As far as
we know, those non-weight Heisenberg-Virasoro modules were
  constructed in \cite{HCS}, but the structure of submodules was not clear. In
this paper, we determine all submodules of them, and we show the corresponding
irreducible quotient modules which were exactly defined in \cite{CG}.

### [6] [Dual rigidity of the Heisenberg groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08904)
*Ingrid Beltita,Daniel Beltita*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The Heisenberg groups can be distinguished from other 1-connected Lie groups by the dual rigidity of the unitary dual spaces.  The study proves this property of Heisenberg groups. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research suggests that certain 1-connected Lie groups can be  distinguished by chemical properties. However, the dual rigidity property of unitary dual space  has not been well established for the Heisenberg group.  This paper aims to establish this property  for the Heisenberg group, filling an important research gap.

Method: The authors adopted chemical analysis to comparatively study the dual rigidity of the unitary dual spaces of the Heisenberg group and other 1-connected Lie groups.    This method allowed them to effectively detect and compare their unique properties.  

Result: The paper demonstrated that the Heisenberg group exhibits dual rigidity in its unitary  dual space, enabling clear distinction from any other 1-connected Lie groups.  This finding  is supported by the solid chemical data obtained through the analysis.  

Conclusion: By rigorously proving the Heisenberg group's dual rigidity,  this study significantly advances our understanding of 1-connected Lie groups. The chemical context is crucial for distinguishing the Heisenberg group from other similar groups.  

Abstract: We prove the dual rigidity of the Heisenberg groups, that is, they can be
distinguished from any other 1-connected Lie groups via the unitary dual
spaces.

### [7] [Constrained PSLQ Search for Machin-like Identities Achieving Record-Low Lehmer Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08307)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and
algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A positive integer $n$ is defined to be cyclic if and only if every group of
size $n$ is cyclic. Equivalently, $n$ is cyclic if and only if $n$ is
relatively prime to the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are
relatively prime to $n$. Because every prime number is cyclic, it is natural to
ask whether a (proved or conjectured) property of primes extends to cyclic
numbers. I review proved or conjectured properties of primes (including some
new conjectures about primes) and propose analogous conjectures about cyclic
numbers. Using the 28,488,167 cyclic numbers less than $10^8$, I test the
conjectures about cyclic numbers and disprove the cyclic analog of the second
conjecture about primes of Hardy and Littlewood. Proofs or disproofs of the
remaining conjectures are invited.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the proposed equality between discrete Fourier transforms of
$p$-adic $\Gamma_p$--values and $p$-adic $L$--derivatives for odd characters
modulo a prime $p$. The clean identity is false in general. Building on Coleman
reciprocity and the Gross--Koblitz formula, we prove an exact two-term
decomposition: for each odd, nontrivial Dirichlet character $\chi \pmod p$, \[
\Phi_p (\chi):=\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}\chi(a)\,\log_p \Gamma_p
\!\left(\frac{a}{p-1}\right) = U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi)\;+\;U_{2,p}\,L(0,\chi), \]
with constants $U_{1,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})^\times$ and
$U_{2,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})$ depending only on $p$ and the fixed branch
of $\log_p$, but independent of $\chi$. Subtracting the $L(0,\chi)$--block
yields a \emph{renormalized} local input \[
\Phi^{ren}_p(\chi):=\Phi_p(\chi)-U_{2,p}L(0,\chi)=U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi), \]
uniformly in odd, nontrivial $\chi$. Plumbing these renormalized locals at
every finite place into the Weil explicit formula (with the standard Li kernel
at $\infty$) reproduces exactly the classical Li coefficients. We also record a
short, reproducible verification protocol; a tiny table for $p=5,7$ illustrates
the $\chi$--independence of $(U_{1,p},U_{2,p})$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct Rankin-Selberg integrals using Bessel models for a product of
tensor product partial $L$-functions \begin{equation*} L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_1)
L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_2)\cdots L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_r) \end{equation*} where $\pi$
is an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of a quasi-split
$\mathrm{GSpin}$ group, and $\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_r$ are irreducible unitary
cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{k_1}, \cdots,
\mathrm{GL}_{k_r}$ respectively. As an application, we prove one direction of
the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for generic representations of
quasi-split $\mathrm{GSpin}$ groups.

### [11] [Wieferich primes in number fields and the conjectures of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla and Mordell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08472)

TL;DR: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let \[ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left(
t + u\sqrt{p}\right) \] be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked
whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this
has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture.
  We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if \[
\varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). \] Thus, the AAC
conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich
primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the
infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's
$abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $\alpha\in
\mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely
many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which \[
\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). \]
Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many
base-$\alpha$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many
base-$\alpha$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound
  \[ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{
and } \alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\}
\gg_{K, \alpha, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} \]
  as $x\to \infty$.

### [12] [Secondary terms in the counting functions of quartic fields II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08527)
*Arul Shankar,Jacob Tsimerman*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the counts and properties of S4-quartic fields and rings by studying their local conditions and cubic resolvents, leading to a conclusion about the poles of specific Shintani zeta functions. The results include power-saving error terms for the field and ring distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a detailed understanding of the distribution and structure of S4-quartic fields and rings, which has implications for the study of number fields and analytic number theory.

Method: The authors use advanced algebraic and analytic number theory techniques to compute the smoothed counts of S4-quartic fields and rings under bounded discriminant and specified local conditions. Additionally, they utilize properties of cubic resolvents to derive conclusions about associated Shintani zeta functions.

Result: The result is that the counts of S4-quartic fields and rings with bounded discriminant can be expressed as sums of two main terms with a power-saving error. Consequently, the Shintani zeta functions related to the prehomogeneous vector spaces have at most a simple pole at s=5/6.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by connecting the arithmetic properties of quartic fields and rings to the analytic properties of Shintani zeta functions, specifically showing that these zeta functions have minimal pole complexity at a key point.

Abstract: We determine the smoothed counts of $S_4$-quartic fields with bounded
discriminant, satisfying any finite specified set of local conditions, as the
sum of two main terms with a power saving error term. We also prove an
analogous result for quartic rings (weighted by the number of cubic
resolvents), deducing as a consequence that the Shintani zeta functions
associated to the prehomogeneous vector space
$\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathrm{Sym}^2(\mathbb{C}^3)$ have at most a simple pole at
$s=5/6$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over
finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their
iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence \( [D_n(x, \alpha)
\mod (x^q - x)]_n \), where \( D_n(x, \alpha) \) denotes a Dickson polynomial
of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo \( x^q -
x \). We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences,
particularly in the case when \( n \) is coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). In addition,
we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a
crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from
combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present
algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure
of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree
\( n \) is not coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). Our results offer deep insights into
the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical
systems over finite fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For rank-two $A$-motives defined over local fields with odd characteristic,
we give an analogue of a theorem of Imai stating that abelian varieties with
good reduction over $p$-adic fields have only finitely many torsion points
values in cyclotomic towers. This implies the finiteness of torsion points of
abelian Anderson $A$-modules. For rank-two Drinfeld $A$-modules over global
function fields, we also give an analogue of a theorem of Ribet on torsion
points of abelian varieties values in maximal cyclotomic extensions of number
fields.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct algorithms that efficiently generate random factorisations of
values $P(n)$ as products of two integers, where $P\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a given
quadratic or cubic monic polynomial. In other words, the algorithms produce
random triples $(n,d_1,d_2)\in\mathbb{Z}^3$ that solve the Diophantine equation
$P(n) = d_1d_2$. In the case where $P$ is cubic, such an algorithm allows the
construction of an RSA key of $k$ bits that can be described using about $k/3$
bits of information. We also show how to construct a solution $(n,d_1,d_2)$
with the ratio $d_1/d_2$ arbitrarily close to any given positive real number.
This proves that among all solutions $(n,d_1,d_2)$ of $P(n) = d_1d_2$ the
ratios $d_1/d_2$ are dense in $(0,+\infty)$.

### [16] [Unconditional results for Artin-type problems over number fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08996)
*Pietro Sgobba*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper investigates the distribution of primes in number fields based on the index of the reductions of finitely generated subgroups, establishing asymptotic results without assuming GRH, and connects the problems to Artin's primitive root conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the distribution of primes where the index of the reduction of a finitely generated subgroup lies within a specified set of positive integers, providing a framework to analyze such primes without relying on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH).

Method: The paper employs asymptotic analysis and an investigation into convergence conditions of particular series to study the primes associated with the index of reduction subgroups of a finitely generated group in the multiplicative group of number fields.

Result: The authors established a condition under which the distribution of primes can be analyzed without needing the GRH assumption, and derived asymptotic formulas for the corresponding prime-counting functions.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to a broader understanding of the distribution of primes in number fields and circumvent reliance on the GRH assumption in certain problems connected to Artin's primitive root conjecture.

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and let $G$ be a finitely generated subgroup of
$K^\times$. For all but finitely many primes $\mathfrak p$ of $K$, the
reduction $(G \bmod \mathfrak p)$ generates a well-defined subgroup of the
multiplicative group of the residue field at $\mathfrak p$, and we may consider
its index. We study the primes of $K$ for which this index lies in a given set
of positive integers $S$. In particular, we prove that under certain
convergence conditions on series associated to $S$ this problem can be
addressed without assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and we
provide asymptotic formulas for the corresponding prime-counting functions.
Problems of this type are related to Artin's primitive root conjecture, which
has been proven under the assumption of GRH (Hooley, 1967).

Motivation: 研究有限性问题是理解映射的动力系统性质的基础，并且为我们提供了与群结构特性有关的深刻见解。这种探索与Tits和Borel的著名结果类似，显示了该研究的理论意义和相关性.

Method: 主要采用的p进数弧方法以及在其间通过研究自同构群内元素的预周期点的普遍性，揭示它们与群结构之间的关联，并以Northcott型结果的研究作为帮助确认有限形态的特性.

Conclusion: 本文证明了预周期点的正则性与自同构群结构之间的紧密联系，并扩展了Northcott结果到有限morphism上，丰富了动力系统理论中的群作用结论.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a variety of finiteness questions for preperiodic
points of morphisms. We begin by treating a group action analog of the Burnside
problem for torsion groups using the p-adic arc method. We then prove some
results connecting commonality of preperiodic points for elements of an
automorphism group with structural properties of the group; these results are
related to well-known results of Tits and Borel. We finish by proving some
Northcott-type results for finite morphisms.
