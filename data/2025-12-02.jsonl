To illustrate the issues, recall that in the complex case it follows from standard arguments that the open disk of convergence cannot contain all the branch points of x unless the series represents a rational function. In the p-adic case, we show that the analogous assertion is not true in complete generality; but we also confirm it in a number of cases, for instance under the assumption that p is not smaller than the degree of s(x) over the field of rational functions of x.

If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \\in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/π^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \\in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$."}

Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis.\n  The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\\mathfrak b \\in [\\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\\mathfrak b \\in [\\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\\mathfrak b \\in \\mathcal{S} \\cdot\\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals.\n  The case where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\\mathcal{S}\\cdot\\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments."}

Also, we construct closed forms that count all Mersenne primes between $0$ and $2^{n+2}-1$, respectively all Fermat primes between $0$ and $6n+5$ and all twin-prime pairs between $0$ and $n$. Every closed form is an arithmetic term, i. e. a fixed finite composition of the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with remainder and the exponentiation $2^n$. While for generating these sets with repetitions, only Wilson's Theorem is applied, for the counting forms we use more specific tests, i.e. Lucas-Lehmer, respectively Pepin, and we apply to some extent Jones' work (see Acta Arithmetica XXXV, pg. 210 - 221, 1979). To count twin primes we apply Clement's Theorem, which is closely related to Wilson's. A closed form to count the Sophie Germain primes can be constructed similarly."}

Firstly, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $ω(n+k) \\leq Ω(n+k) \\ll k$ for all positive integers $k$, establishing a conjecture of Erdős and Straus. Secondly, we show that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} ω(n)/2^n$ is irrational, settling a conjecture of Erdős. Thirdly, we prove an asymptotic formula conjectured by Erdős, Pomerance and Sárközy for the number of $n\\leq x$ satisfying $ω(n)=ω(n+1)$, for almost all $x$, with similar results for $Ω$ and $τ$. Common to the resolution of all these problems is the use of the probabilistic method. For the first problem, this is combined with computations involving a high-dimensional sieve of Maynard-type. For the second and third problems, we instead make use of a general quantitative estimate for two-point correlations of multiplicative functions with a small power of logarithm saving that may be of independent interest. This correlation estimate is derived by using recent work of Pilatte."}

Using a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. It also gives infinite families of recursion relations among special values of the Riemann zeta function and of Dirichlet $L$-functions.\n  Concerning zeros, we prove that, for odd primitive characters, a natural asymptotic functional equation for the discrete functions $L_n$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros."}

The result has the geometric analogue that the slopes of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of relative dualizing sheaf provide an upper bound for self-intersection number. Suppose that the arithmetic surface admits a section and has generic fiber of genus at least two, we obtain a refined upper bound for the self-intersection number, which is governed by the topological and arithmetic information of the section."}

The authors welcome comments and suggestions for improvement", "summary": "Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \\cong \\mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \\in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \\otimes_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules."}
