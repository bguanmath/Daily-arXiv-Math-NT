The concept of good\nintegers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due\nto their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications\nin various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical\nfoundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental\nnumber-theoretic properties of good integers and present their\ncharacterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with\nwell-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their\ncomputation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good\nintegers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in\nthe characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes\nand complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples\nare provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory.
