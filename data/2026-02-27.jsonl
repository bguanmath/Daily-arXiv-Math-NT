Submitted to the 17th Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium", "summary": "We define two new problems called SIAP and CAP related to solving SIVP and CVP in a subset of lattices called Simultaneous Approximation (SA) lattices. We give dimension- and gap-preserving, deterministic polynomial-time and space reductions from SVP$_γ$, SIVP$_γ$, and CVP$_γ$ to their corresponding problems in SA lattices. These reductions show that instances of these problems in SA lattices are just as hard as general instances and thus are interesting new problems to consider for use in cryptography. We also show that the reductions are optimal in regards to integer inflation."}

Here, we review Legendre's conjecture on primes between consecutive squares and recent progress on the weaker question of primes between consecutive larger powers. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH), we observe that a recent result of Emanuel Carneiro, Micah Milinovich and Kannan Soundararajan, combined with a large-scale computation by Jonathan Sorenson and Jonathan Webster, implies the existence of primes between $x^{2+δ}$ and $(x+1)^{2+δ}$ for all real $x \\geq 1$ when $δ\\geq 1/4$. For smaller values of $δ> 0$, we provide an explicit bound $x_0 = x_0 (δ)$ such that primes exist in these intervals whenever $x \\geq x_0$ (again assuming RH). We conclude with an application to Mills-type prime-generating constants."}

We consider the embedding of reduced C*-algebras constructed recently in connection with the Mackey bijection, and study its behavior on certain natural stratifications of the tempered duals. We formulate our result using a notion of stratified equivalence inspired by the study of the smooth dual of $p$-adic groups via the structure of Hecke algebras, in particular by the work of Aubert, Baum, Plymen and Solleveld. We derive related new topological properties of the Mackey bijection. We also analyze the behavior of the Mackey embedding on a stratification of reduced C*-algebras attached to a partition of the tempered dual into particularly elementary pieces, introduced in recent work of Bradd, Higson and Yuncken."}
