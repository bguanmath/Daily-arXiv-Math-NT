In case when $G$ is a complex\nreflection group and $\\mathcal A=\\mathcal A(G)$ is its reflection arrangement\nin $V$, Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\\\"ohrle studied the invariants of the $Q\nG$-module $H^*(M(\\mathcal A);Q)$, the rational, singular cohomology of the\ncomplement space $M(\\mathcal A)$ in $V$. In this paper we generalize the work\nin Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\\\"ohrle to the case of quaternionic reflection\ngroups. We obtain a straightforward generalization of the Hilbert--Poincar\\'e\nseries of the ring of invariants in the cohomology from the complex case when\nthe quaternionic reflection group is complex-reducible according to Cohen's\nclassification. Surprisingly, only one additional family of new types of\nPoincar\\'e polynomials occurs in the quaternionic setting which is not realised\nin the complex case, namely those of a particular class of imprimitive\nirreducible quaternionic reflection groups.

Each closed-form consists of a fixed\nnumber of elementary arithmetic operations drawn from the set: addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation.\n  Two families of closed-forms are developed. First, direct application of the\nhypercube method yields closed-forms $T_1(n)$, $T_2(n)$, $T_3(n)$, and $T_4(n)$\nexpressing the smallest prime divisor, largest non-trivial divisor, largest\nprime divisor, and greatest prime $\\leq n$, respectively. The\nfactorial-unwinding technique underlying these hypercube constructions leads to\nextreme symbolic complexity, motivating our main result: An alternative\nclosed-form $T(n)$ that avoids factorial-unwinding by synthesizing the\nquadratic residue invariants $\\chi(n)$ (largest $r$ such that $r^2$ is a\ndivisor) and $\\omega(n)$ (number of distinct prime divisors) with integer root\nextraction.\n  Although evaluating these closed-forms requires exponential time, the number\nof arithmetic operations performed remains constant and independent of the\ninput size $n$. This sharply contrasts with traditional algorithmic methods,\nwhere the number of operations required to locate a non-trivial divisor\nnecessarily scales with $n$."}
