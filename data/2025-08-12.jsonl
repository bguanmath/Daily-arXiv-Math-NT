A triangular number $N$ is called\nsquare if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number\n$d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in\none-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples\n$(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product\n$\\Pi = \\Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$\nand $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4.\nQuadratic number $\\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if\n$\\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular\nnumbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist\ninfinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials\n$j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations:\n$k + j_{2 \\ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\\ell k^\\ell + \\dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1)\n[b_\\ell k^\\ell + \\dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \\newline $k + j_{2\\ell+1}(k) + 1 =\nk(k+1) [a_\\ell k^\\ell + \\dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\\ell+1}\nk^{\\ell+1}+b_\\ell k^\\ell + \\dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer\n$\\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \\ldots, \\ell, j=0, \\ldots,\n\\ell+1$.
