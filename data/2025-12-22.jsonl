Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen et al., we confirm the conjecture in \\cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite."}

Furthermore, we explore a variety of properties of these generalized Dedekind sums: we develop a finite sum formula, demonstrate their behavior as quantum modular forms, provide a Fricke reciprocity law, and characterize analytic and arithmetic aspects of their image. Particularly, for the arithmetic aspect of the image, we generalize an existing conjecture to the higher weight case and provide significant computational evidence to support this generalized conjecture."}

Given an integer $t\\geq2$ and a real, positive function $ψ$, let $W_{t}(ψ)$ denote the set of $x$ in $[0,1]$ for which $|x-p/t^{n}|<ψ(n)$ for infinitely many $(p,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{N}$. We prove a general Hausdorff dimension result concerning the intersection of $W_{t}(ψ)$ with an arbitrary self similar set which implies that $\\dim_{\\rm H}(W_{t}(ψ)\\cap C(b,D))\\le\\dim_{\\rm H}W_{t}(ψ)\\times \\dim_{\\rm H}C(b,D)$. When $b$ and $t$ have the same prime divisors, under certain restrictions on the digit set $D$, we give a sufficient condition for the Hausdorff measure of $W_{t}(ψ)\\cap C(b,D)$ to be zero. This closes a gap in a result of Li, Li and Wu \\cite{LLW2025} and shows that the dimension of the intersection can be strictly less than the product of the dimensions. The latter disproves the product conjecture of Li, Li and Wu."}
