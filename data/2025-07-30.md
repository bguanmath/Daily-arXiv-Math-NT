Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider certain Lambert series as generating functions of divisor sums
twisted by Dirichlet characters and compute their exact resurgent transseries
expansion near $q=1^-$. For special values of the parameters, these Lambert
series are expressible in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein
series twisted by the same characters and the transseries representation is a
direct consequence of the action of Fricke involution on such twisted
Eisenstein series. When the parameters of the Lambert series are generic the
transseries representation provides for a quantum-modular version of Fricke
involution which for a particular example we show being equivalent to modular
resurgent structures found in topological strings observables.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of simultaneously
$\lambda$-well approximable points on the Veronese curve in $\RR^3$ for $1/3\le
\lambda\le 3/5$. This range for $\lambda$ was predicted in the conjecture of
Beresnevich and Yang from~\cite{ber_yan_2023}. To the best of the author's
knowledge, this makes $\VVV_3$ the first nondegenerate curve in $\RR^n$, $n\ge
3$, to confirm the lower bound part of this conjecture.

### [4] [The Fourier coefficients and singular moduli of the elliptic modular function $j(τ)$, revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21514)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Kaneko's formula expresses the Fourier coefficients of the elliptic modular
$j$-function as finite sums of singular moduli. First published as a short
article in 1996, it was presented as a consequence of Zagier's work inspired by
Borcherds products. Since then, the formula has developed into a broader
framework that links the Fourier coefficients of modular forms to the special
values of modular functions, extending in various directions. This article
surveys these subsequent developments.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer, $q$ a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ the
finite field with $q$ elements. Consider the problem of showing existence of
primitive elements in a subset $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^r}$. We
prove a sieve criterion for existence of such elements, dependent only on an
estimate for the character sum $\sum_{\gamma \in \mathcal{A}}\chi(\gamma)$. The
flexibility and direct applicability of our criterion should be of considerable
interest for problems in this field. We demonstrate the utility of our result
by tackling a problem of Fernandes and Reis (2021) with $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding
affine hyperplanes, obtaining significant improvements over previous knowledge.

### [6] [The imaginary case of the nonabelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21558)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a finite group $\Gamma$, we study the distribution of the Galois group
$G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ of the maximal unramified extension of $K$ that is
split completely at $\infty$ and has degree prime to $|\Gamma|$ and
$\textit{Char}(K)$, as $K$ varies over imaginary $\Gamma$-extensions of
$\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. In the function field case, we compute the
moments of the distribution of $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ by counting points on
Hurwitz stacks. In order to understand the probability of the distribution, we
prove that $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ admits presentations of a specific form,
then use this presentation to build random groups to simulate the behavior of
$G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$, and make the conjecture to predict the distribution
using the probability measures of these random groups. Our results provide the
imaginary analog of the work of Wood, Zureick-Brown, and the first author on
the nonabelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that the vanishing of the module of universal norms associated with
certain de Rham Galois representations characterises the algebraic extensions
of the field of $p$-adic numbers whose completion is a perfectoid field. We
thereby generalise results by Coates and Greenberg for abelian varieties, and
by Bondarko for $p$-divisible groups.

### [8] [Quadratic forms of holomorphic cusp forms and the decay of their $\ell^p$-norms for $0 < p < 2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21951)
*Shenghao Hua*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper shows that certain quadratic forms of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms cannot be represented as bounded linear combinations of these forms when their weights exceed a constant, and also demonstrates that their $\ell^p$-norms (for $0 < p < 2$) tend to zero asymptotically in an orthonormal basis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how quadratic combinations of modular forms relate to their individual properties and analyzing the behavior of norms in such settings can provide insight into the structure of modular forms families and their interactions.

Method: The authors use orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms to study the nature of quadratic forms constructed from them. They derive conditions on coefficients that influence whether a quadratic form remains in the linear span of these forms and analyze the decay of $\ell^p$-norms for such forms when $p$ lies in a particular range.

Result: The paper shows that if the coefficients of quadratic forms satisfy nonvanishing and boundedness conditions, and the total weight exceeds an absolute constant, the forms are not representable as bounded linear combinations. Additionally, it proves that the $\ell^p$-norms for $0 < p < 2$ decay to zero asymptotically in the orthonormal basis.

Conclusion: These results demonstrate the limitations of expressing quadratic forms in terms of bounded combinations of modular forms and highlight the asymptotic vanishings of such forms under specific norms. This may influence future problems in the theory of modular forms and related areas.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic
Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each
expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms --
are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of
holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute
constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy
appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the
finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms
equated to a quadratic form of large weight.
  We also show that, conditionally, for $0 < p < 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such
quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically
with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.

### [9] [Coh zeta functions for inert quadratic orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21966)
*Yifeng Huang*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper studies the Coh zeta function for inert quadratic orders and conjectures a connection to $t$-deformed Bressoud q-series, providing explicit formulas and using Mobius inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending previous work connecting zeta functions of quadratic orders to classical q-series identities.

Method: A new method based on Mobius inversion on posets.

Result: Derivation of the first explicit formulas for the finitized Coh zeta function for the simplest inert order and the t=1 specialization for all orders in the family.

Conclusion: The study suggests a deep connection between Coh zeta functions and quantum modular forms via t-deformed identities.

Abstract: We study the Coh zeta function for a family of inert quadratic orders, which
we conjecture to be given by $t$-deformed Bressoud $q$-series. This completes a
trilogy connecting the zeta functions of ramified and split quadratic orders to
the classical Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities, respectively. We provide
strong evidence for this conjecture by deriving the first explicit formulas for
the finitized Coh zeta function of the simplest order in the family, and for
the $t=1$ specialization of the finitized Coh zeta functions for all orders in
the family. Our primary tool is a new method based on M\"obius inversion on
posets.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a product of fundamental crystals of type $C_n$ in monomial
realization, where the product means a natural product of Laurent monomials,
not a tensor product. Then we shall show that the product still holds a crystal
structure and describe how it is decomposed into irreducible crystals, which
is, in general, different from the decomposition rule for the tensor product of
the fundamental crystals.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The diagonal reduction algebra of a reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a
localization of the Mickelsson algebra associated to the symmetric pair
$(\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g},\, \mathfrak{g})$. In 2010, Khoroshkin and
Ogievetsky introduced the methods of stabilization and cutting, which relate
the commutation relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of
$\mathfrak{gl}_m\oplus\mathfrak{gl}_n$ with those in the diagonal reduction
algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{m+n}$. We extend this method to a wide range of
reduction algebras, including all diagonal and differential reduction algebras
for basic classical Lie superalgebras. We show how the method can be used for
computing relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{so}_8$ and
differential reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: There is a homomorphism of associative superalgebras from the enveloping
algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ to the
Weyl-Clifford superalgebra $W(2n|n)$ with $2n$ even Weyl algebra generators and
$n$ odd Clifford algebra generators. Under this homomorphism, the positive odd
root vector $x\in\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ is sent to the Dirac operator
$\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\in W(2n|n)$ and generates a left ideal $I$. The
corresponding reduction (super)algebra, denoted $Z_n$, is the normalizer of $I$
in $W(2n|n)$ modulo $I$. By construction, $Z_n$ acts on the space of all
Clifford algebra-valued polynomial solutions to the (massless) Dirac equation.
In this paper, we find a complete presentation of (a localization of) this
so-termed Dirac reduction algebra. Furthermore, we use the Dirac reduction
algebra to generate all polynomial solutions to the Dirac equation in
$n$-dimensional flat spacetime.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F})$, $\mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb{F})$, or
$\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{F})$ be one of the classical groups over an
algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$, let $\breve{G}$
be the MVW-extension of $G$, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$.
In this paper, we classify the closed orbits in the enhanced standard
representation $\mathfrak{g}\times E$ of $G$, where $E$ is the natural
representation if $G=\mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb{F})$ or
$\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{F})$, and is the direct sum of the natural
representation and its dual if $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F})$. Additionally, for
every closed $G$-orbit in $\mathfrak{g}\times E$, we prove that it is
$\breve{G}$-stable, and determine explicitly the corresponding stabilizer group
as well as the action on the normal space.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates simple modules of the semi-direct product algebra
$\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$, where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Witt algebra and
$\widehat{H_4}$ is the loop Diamond algebra. We first use simple modules over
the Weyl algebra to construct a family of simple
$\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$-modules. Then, we classify simple
$\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$-modules that are free
$U(\mathbb{C}L_0\oplus\mathbb{C} a_0)$-modules of rank 1. Finally, we give a
necessary and sufficient condition for finitely many simple
$U(\mathbb{C}L_0\oplus\mathbb{C}a_0)$-free modules to be simple, and then
determine their isomorphism classes.

module, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Cartan subalgebra. We establish necessary
and sufficient conditions for simplicity and determine the corresponding
isomorphism classes.
