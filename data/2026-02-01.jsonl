In the first part of the paper, we apply the Hardy--Littlewood circle method to obtain asymptotic formulas for weighted count of representations of such integers up to $g^k$ as $k\\to\\infty$, where we weight by the von Mangoldt function. In this case, we also get an interesting bias depending on the fixed digit we are missing. In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\\{ n \\leq g^k : n \\text{ omits the digit } b \\text{ in its base } g \\text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \\text{ for some primes } p,q \\}. $$"}

Using this criterion, we characterize Pollack's quaternionic Saito-Kurokawa subspace by imposing a system of linear relation among certain primitive Fourier coefficients. This characterization strengthens earlier work of the author with Johnson-Leung, Negrini, Pollack, and Roy. We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$. Here we establish a new relationship between the degenerate Fourier coefficients of quaternionic modular forms, and the Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic modular forms associated to their constant terms. As a consequence, we prove that in weights $\\ell\\geq 5$, a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ is cuspidal if and only if its non-degenerate Fourier coefficients satisfy a polynomial growth condition."}

In the case that $σ$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $σ$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization."}
