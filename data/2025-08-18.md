Abstract: Fix an odd prime $p$ and let $f$ be a non-ordinary eigen-cuspform of weight
$k$ and level coprime to $p$. Assuming $p>k-1$, we compute asymptotic formulas
for the Iwasawa invariants of the Mazur-Tate elements attached to $f$ in terms
of the corresponding invariants of the signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. By
combining this with a version of mod $p$ multiplicity one, we also obtain
descriptions of the $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur-Tate elements attached to
certain higher weight modular forms with Serre weight $<p+1$, generalizing
results of Pollack and Weston in the Serre weight 2 case.

Abstract: Let $C$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Harvey and Sutherland's
implementation of Harvey's average polynomial-time algorithm computes the
$\bmod \ p$ reduction of the numerator of the zeta function of $C$ at all good
primes $p\leq B$ in $O(B\log^{3+o(1)}B)$ time, which is $O(\log^{4+o(1)} p)$
time on average per prime. Alternatively, their algorithm can do this for a
single good prime $p$ in $O(p^{1/2}\log^{1+o(1)}p)$ time. While Harvey's
algorithm can also be used to compute the full zeta function, no practical
implementation of this step currently exists.
  In this article, we present an $O(\log^{2+o(1)}p)$ Las Vegas algorithm that
takes the $\bmod \ p$ output of Harvey and Sutherland's implementation and
outputs the full zeta function. We then benchmark our results against the
fastest algorithms currently available for computing the full zeta function of
a genus~$2$ curve, finding substantial speedups in both the average
polynomial-time and single prime settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Residue number systems based on pairwise relatively prime moduli are a
powerful tool for accelerating integer computations via the Chinese Remainder
Theorem. We study a structured family of moduli of the form $2^n - 2^k + 1$,
originally proposed for their efficient arithmetic and bit-level properties.
These trinomial moduli support fast modular operations and exhibit scalable
modular inverses.
  We investigate the problem of constructing large sets of pairwise relatively
prime trinomial moduli of fixed bit length. By analyzing the corresponding
trinomials $x^n - x^k + 1$, we establish a sufficient condition for coprimality
based on polynomial resultants. This leads to a graph-theoretic model where
maximal sets correspond to cliques in a compatibility graph, and we use maximum
clique-finding algorithms to construct large examples in practice. Using the
theory of graph colorings, resultants, and properties of cyclotomic
polynomials, we also prove upper bounds on the size of such sets as a function
of $n$.

### [4] [On a remark of Serre](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11048)
*Katie Ahrens,Jon Grantham*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper searches for primes $p$ where the maximum Hasse bound for the number of points on an elliptic curve over $
F_{p^5}$ is not achieved, provides a list of all $q<10^{70}$ with the same property, and explores similar criteria for genus 2 and 3 curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paper Motivation:
-Inspired by Serre's remark, there is a theoretical interest in understanding elliptic curves and their point counts under the Hasse bound.
-Extends the search for primes where the Hasse bound for elliptic curves over $
F_{p^5}$ is not achieved.
-Explores heuristics to estimate the number of such cases.
-Also examines similar properties for genus 2 and 3 curves for broader implications.

Method: Paper Methods:
-Extends the search from previous studies to identify primes $p$ where the maximum Hasse bound over $
F_{p^5}$ is not achieved for elliptic curves.
-Utilizes algorithms and number theory to compile a list of all $q<10^{70}$ where the Hasse bound is not achieved.
-Investigates heuristic models to predict the density or distribution of such $q$-values.
-Adapts these heuristics for genus 2 and 3 curves to explore analogous phenomena.

Result: Key Results:
-Identified primes $p$ where the maximum Hasse bound for the number of points on an elliptic curve is not achieved over $
F_{p^5}$.
-Generated a comprehensive list of $q$-values (under $10^{70}$) where the Hasse bound fails to be realized for the given elliptic curve conditions.
-Provided heuristic arguments for estimating the expected number of such $q$-values in various ranges.
-For genus 2 and 3 curves, outlined criteria similar to the genus 1 case and discussed their potential existence and distribution.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to the understanding of the Hasse bound in the context of elliptic and higher genus curves. By extending the search threshold and providing heuristic models, it sheds light on the scarcity or abundance of primes where the Hasse bound is not achieved. The findings add to the theoretical framework of algebraic curves over finite fields and present open questions for further research.

Abstract: Inspired by a remark of Serre, we extend the search for primes $p$ such that
the maximum Hasse bound for the number of points on an elliptic curve over
$\mathbb{F}_{p^5}$ is not achieved. We then give a list of all $q<10^{70}$ such
that the Hasse bound is not achieved over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We explore the
heuristics for how many such numbers should exist in each case. Finally, look
at similar criteria for genus $2$ and $3$ curves.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the notions of local realizability at a prime and algebraic
realizability of an integer sequence. After discussing this notion in general
we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the
Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of
the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli
denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the
great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the
sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may
explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.

### [6] [Locally analytic completed cohomology of Shimura varieties of Hodge type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11099)
*Kensuke Aoki*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: For Hodge type Shimura varieties, there exist natural isomorphisms between cohomology groups of locally analytic complete cohomology and flag varieties with coefficients given by their perfectoid covers. This generalizes prior results by different researchers for modular curves and unitary Shimura curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research extends the understanding of cohomological properties for Shimura varieties beyond previous limited cases (modular and unitary curves) by exploring isomorphisms under a broader Hodge type condition and utilizing perfectoid spaces, which might reveal deeper connections in arithmetic geometry.

Method: The authors worked with Hodge type Shimura varieties, and studied cohomology groups using perfectoid covers of these varieties to establish the relation with flag varieties, leading to natural isomorphisms.

Result: Natural isomorphisms are established showing the equivalence between cohomology in the flag variety setting using perfectoid coefficients and locally analytic complete cohomology for a broader class of Hodge type Shimura varieties.

Conclusion: The study generalizes previous cohomology results to Hodge type Shimura varieties, potentially contributing future insights in arithmetic geometry by connecting two important cohomological frameworks.

Abstract: For Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we show that there are natural
isomorphisms between locally analytic complete cohomology groups and cohomology
groups for flag varieties with coefficient which is given by their perfectoid
covers. This result is a generalization of that of Pan for the modular curve
and Qiu-Su for unitary Shimura curves.

TL;DR: 本文利用变分法构造了适用于Levinson方法的新的黎曼ζ函数导数线性组合，显示出即使使用较短的删基函数，也能显著增加在临界线上零点的比例，并扩展到模形式L-函数。同时还提供了非平凡的光滑逼近的Siegel的$ℕ$函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在利用变分法和Levinson方法来改进对黎曼ζ函数和模形式L-函数在临界线上零点比例的估计，同时减少对较长删基函数的依赖。

Method: 应用变分法构造新的黎曼ζ函数导数线性组合，改进Levinson方法中的删基选择，从而更有效地分析零点分布。

Result: 使用较短的删基函数时，新线性组合显著提高了黎曼ζ函数和模形式L-函数在临界线上的零点比例，达到前人研究的两倍以上。此外，这些组合还提供了Siegel的$ℕ$函数的光滑逼近。

Conclusion: 作者表明，在较短的删基函数的情况下，优化线性组合比优化删基函数本身对提高临界线上零点比例有更大的作用。这种新方法在黎曼ζ函数和模形式L-函数中均表现出色，并揭示了与著名Riemann-Siegel公式的联系。

Abstract: We apply the calculus of variations to construct a new sequence of linear
combinations of derivatives of the Riemann $\zeta$-function adapted to
Levinson's method, which yield a positive proportion of zeros of the
$\zeta$-function on the critical line, regardless of how short the mollifier
is. Our construction extends readily to modular $L$-functions. Even with
Levinson's original choice of mollifier, our method more than doubles the
proportions of zeros on the critical line for modular $L$-functions previously
obtained by Bernard and K\"uhn--Robles--Zeindler, while relying on the same
arithmetic inputs. This indicates that optimizing the linear combinations, an
approach that has received relatively little attention, has a more pronounced
effect than refining the mollifier when it is short. Curiously, our linear
combinations provide non-trivial smooth approximations of Siegel's
$\mathfrak{f}$-function in the celebrated Riemann--Siegel formula.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The P\'olya group ${\rm Po}(K)$ of a number field $K$ is the subgroup of the
ideal class group ${\rm Cl}(K)$ of $K$ generated by the classes of all the
products of the prime ideals of $K$ with the same norm. Motivated by the
classical "one class in each genus problem", we prove general finiteness
theorems for the number fields $K$ with a fixed P\'olya index $\left[{\rm
Cl}(K):{\rm Po}(K)\right]$ in the families of Galois number fields, solvable
CM-fields, and real quadratic fields of extended R-D type. We also give
classification results for specific families. Most notably, we classify,
unconditionally, all imaginary bi-quadratic and imaginary tri-quadratic fields
with the P\'olya index one. Furthermore, we classify all real quadratic fields
of extended R-D type (with possibly only one more field) with the P\'olya index
one. Also, under GRH, we give the complete list of 161 imaginary quadratic
fields with the P\'olya index two. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we
extend, from narrow R-D types to the extended R-D types, Dohmae's
classification of real quadratic fields of narrow R-D type whose narrow genus
numbers equal their narrow class numbers.

<details>

Motivation: Serre对于无CM椭圆曲线在数域L中的普通约减素数密度为1的结果，以及继Katz和Ogus对阿贝尔曲面之后的研究进展，Sawin最近对普通约减素数的密度进行了深入研究。现有成果的推广需要进一步探索高维阿贝尔流形的适用条件。

Method: 作者采用结构化数学方法分析高维阿贝尔流形的约减密度问题，结合Sawin模型和具体例子如三次到七次曲线雅可比族进行推导。

Result: 论文提供了阿贝尔流形A具有CM体F作为在其上的乘法作用满足特定条件时的普通约减密度结果，通过具体例子验证了理论推导。

Conclusion: 论文在高维阿贝尔流形普通约减密度计算上取得重要进展，扩展了现有理论，并获得了实际例子的验证。

Abstract: By a result of Serre, if $A$ is an elliptic curve without CM defined over a
number field $L$, then the set of primes of $L$ for which $A$ has ordinary
reduction has density $1$. Katz and Ogus proved the same is true when $A$ is an
abelian surface, after possibly passing to a finite extension of $L$. More
recently, Sawin computed the density of the set of primes of $L$ for which an
abelian surface $A$ has ordinary reduction, depending on the endomorphism
algebra of $A$. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of these results
when $A$ is an absolutely simple abelian variety of arbitrary dimension whose
endomorphism algebra is a CM field $F$, under specific conditions on the
signature of the multiplication action of $F$ on $A$. We include explicit
examples from Jacobians of curves of genus three through seven admitting cyclic
covers to the projective line.

Abstract: Let $(q_{\alpha, n})_{n \geq 0}$ be the sequence of convergent denominators

that there are only finitely many integers $c$ such that the equation
$q_{\alpha, n} - q_{\beta, m} = c$ has at least two distinct solutions $(n,m)$,
where $\alpha,\beta$ are quadratic irrationals with $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\neq
\mathbb{Q}(\beta)$. In specific instances, we solve the equation $q_{\alpha, n}
- q_{\beta, m} = c$ completely and explicitly list all solutions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics
and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$,
with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$
is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit
$\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$
admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with
\begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for
all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor
\begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between
the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the
category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost
$(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous
result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our
approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely
determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$,
rather than being determined only up to equivalence.
  We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful
embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps
into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1},
(\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through
the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1},
(\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic
spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this
embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an
almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.

### [13] [Alpay Folded Prime Enumerator via gcd and Floors: Exact Enumeration, Record-Lift, and Non-Synonymy/Minimality Certificates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11466)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A single closed expression $f_{\text{Alpay},U}(x)$ is presented which, for
every integer $x\ge 0$, returns the $(x+1)$-th prime $p_{x+1}$. The
construction uses only integer arithmetic, greatest common divisors, and floor
functions. A prime indicator $I(j)$ is encoded through a short $\gcd$-sum; a
cumulative counter $S(i)=\sum_{j\le i}I(j)$ equals $\pi(i)$; and a folded step
$A(i,x)$ counts precisely up to the next prime index without piecewise
branching. A corollary shows that for any fixed integer $L\ge 2$, the integer
$P^\star=f_{\text{Alpay},U}(L)$ is prime and $P^\star>L$. Two explicit
schedules $U(x)$ are given: a square schedule $U_{\text{sq}}(x)=(x+1)^2$ and a
near-linear schedule $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}(x)=\Theta(x\log x)$ justified by
explicit bounds on $p_n$. We include non-synonymy certificates relative to
Willans-type enumerators (schedule and operator-signature separation) and prove
an asymptotic minimality bound: any forward-count enumerator requires
$U(x)=\Omega(x\log x)$ while $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}$ achieves $O(x\log x)$. We
also provide explicit operation counts (''form complexity'') of the folded
expression.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension
of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that
are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to
the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed
versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements
for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms
of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include
infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura
varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic
construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura
case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic
local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed
structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a
$p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map
whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a
closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a
category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve.
These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting.
We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of
``differential topology for diamonds."

Motivation: 文中所开展的项目旨在进一步探索表示理论、Euler元素、因果楔形空间及其在代数量子场论中的应用。正交Euler对是这一领域的一个关键概念，用来构建几何与物理结构之间的联系，同时也为分析AQFT中的因果结构提供理论基础。

Method: 在论文中，围绕Euler元素的正交关系展开研究，利用李代数的理论工具来分类正交Euler对。引入了抽象Euler楔形空间的数学结构，并通过链式的逐级互补概念将因境界域与纯群论方式定义的结构联系起来。

Result: 本文在正交Euler对的研究中取得了三项主要成果：第一，证明了满足正交条件的两个Euler元素 (h,k) 与它们的反序 (k,h) 会在三维李代数中生成一个简单位形元素；第二，给出了简单李代数中正交Euler对的分类；第三，通过链式的因果互补关系证明了任意一对扭转互补可以通过从三维子代数的连续互补构造连接。

Conclusion: 这项研究强化了李代数理论在代数量子场论和数学物理中的基础地位，并为因果结构和对称性提供了新的数学工具和视角。分类和构造结果可能对进一步探讨局部对称性和具有因果属性的几何对象产生深远影响。

Abstract: The current article continues our project
  on representation theory, Euler elements, causal homogeneous spaces and
  Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT).
  We call a pair (h,k) of Euler elements
  orthogonal if $e^{\pi i \ad h} k = -k$.
  We show that, if (h,k) and (k,h) are orthogonal, then
  they generate a 3-dimensional simple subalgebra.
  We also classify orthogonal Euler pairs in simple Lie algebras
  and determine the fundamental groups of adjoint Euler elements
  in arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
  Causal complements of wedge regions in spacetimes
  can be related to so-called
  twisted complements in the space
  of abstract Euler wedges, defined in purely group theoretic terms.
  We show that any pair of twisted complements can be connected
  by a chain of successive complements coming from $3$-dimensional subalgebras.
