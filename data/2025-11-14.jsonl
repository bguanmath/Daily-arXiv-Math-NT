We show that the contravariant functor ${ }^{0}$ is right adjoint to the contravariant functor ${ }^{*c}$. We define the Loc functor from the category of differential Lie coalgebras to the category of locally finite differential Lie coalgebras, associating to any differential Lie coalgebra $M$ the differential Lie coalgebra Loc$(M)$, defined as the largest locally finite differential Lie subcoalgebra of $M$. We prove that for any Lie conformal algebra $L$ that is free as a $\\mathbb{C}[\\partial]$-module, Loc$(L^{0})$ is the set of conformal linear maps on $L$ whose kernel contains an ideal of $L$ of cofinite rank. In general, $L^{0}$ will not be locally finite, so $\\operatorname{Loc}\\left(L^{0}\\right) \\varsubsetneqq L^{0}$. We present an example illustrating this."}

While several explicit Padé approximants are known for powers of exponential functions, binomial functions, and logarithmic functions individually, an explicit Padé construction for the product of these functions has not yet been directly achieved. Our main result yields arithmetic applications, providing new linear independence measures for linear forms in $(1+α)^{ω_i}\\log^{j_i}(1+α)$ for $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $0 \\le j_i \\le r_i - 1$, where $0 < m, r_1, \\ldots, r_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}$, $ω_1, \\ldots, ω_m \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and $0 \\le ω_1 < \\cdots < ω_m < 1$. These results hold with algebraic coefficients in both the complex and $p$-adic cases. Additionally, we establish that Padé approximation of a single polylogarithm is, in general, perfect."}

In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $σ$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$.
