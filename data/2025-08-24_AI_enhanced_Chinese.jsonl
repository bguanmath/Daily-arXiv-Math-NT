Dave Benson has conjectured\nthat if $p=2$ and $V$ is an odd-dimensional indecomposable representation of\n$G$ then all summands of the tensor product $V \\otimes V^*$ except for $\\Bbbk$\nhave even dimension. It is known that the analogous result for general $p$ is\nfalse. In this paper, we investigate the class of graded representations $V$\nwhich have dimension coprime to $p$ and for which $V \\otimes V^*$ has a\nnon-trivial summand of dimension coprime to $p$, for a graded group scheme\nclosely related to $\\mathbb{Z}/p^r \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p^s\n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $p>2$. We produce\nan infinite family of such representations in characteristic 3 and show in\nparticular that the tensor subcategory generated by any of these\nrepresentations in the semisimplification contains the modulo $3$ reduction of\nthe category of representations of the symmetric group $S_3$. Our results are\ncompatible with a general version of Benson's conjecture due to Etingof.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7d20\u6570\u4e3a\u5947\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6784\u9020\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7fa4\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6a213\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65e0\u9650\u8868\u793a\u65cf\uff0c\u5176\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4 S_3 \u7684\u8868\u793a\u6a213\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5b50\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e Etingof \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49 Benson \u731c\u60f3\u60f3\u547c\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "Dave Benson \u7684\u731c\u60f3\u5728 p=2 \u65f6\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u5947\u7d20\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002Etingof \u7684\u731c\u60f3\u8bd5\u56fe\u63a8\u5e7f\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u6ee1\u8db3\u67d0\u4e9b\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u4e0ep\u4e92\u8d28\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8868\u793a V\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef $V \tensor V^*$ \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5728p=3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u65e0\u9650\u8868\u793a\u65cf\u8bba\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7d20\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u5305\u542b $S_3$ \u7684\u6a21\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u5b50\u8303\u7574\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728 p=3 \u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u6a213\u8868\u793a\u65cf V\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97 $V \tensor V^*$ \u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u4e2d\u9664 $\be$ \u5916\u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u5747\u4e3a\u5076\u6570\u7ef4\u3002\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b V \u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u8303\u7574\u4e2d\u5305\u542b $S_3$ \u7684\u6a213\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5947\u7d20\u6570 (\u7279\u522b\u662f3) \u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e Etingof \u987e\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86 Benson \u731c\u60f3\u5728\u5947\u7d20\u6570\u8bbe\u7684\u66f4\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002"}}
