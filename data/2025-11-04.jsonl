Although this system is beyond the reach of computer\nalgebra packages, we can use a specialization argument to prove it is\ngenerically inconsistent. This is delicate because resultants commute with\nspecialization only when the leading coefficients do not specialize to $0$.\nUsing a Newton polygon argument, we are able to compute the relevant degrees\nand justify the claim that for $k$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions.\n  These results support the conjecture that $E_{2k}(q)g(q)$ can be\nmultiplicative only for $k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7$."}

However, it has been proved that at least one of them is\ntranscendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of\nHardy, equivalent to $\\gamma + \\delta/e = \\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has\nbeen generalized to $\\gamma^{(n)} + \\delta^{(n)}/e = \\eta^{(n)}$; $n \\ge 0$ for\nsequences of constants $\\gamma^{(n)}$, $\\delta^{(n)}$, and $\\eta^{(n)}$ (given\nrespectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1)\nprobability distribution). We first investigate the $\\gamma^{(n)}$ through\nrecurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair\n{$\\gamma,\\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set\n{$\\gamma,\\gamma^{(n)},\\gamma^{(n+1)},\\ldots,\\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \\ge 2$)\nare transcendental. This result implies $\\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental\ninfinitely often for $n \\ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii,\nthat the $\\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore\ntranscendental) for all $n \\ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each\npair, {$\\gamma^{(n)},\\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\\gamma^{(n)},\\delta^{(n)}$}, and at\nleast two of the triple {$\\gamma^{(n)},\\delta^{(n)}/e,\\delta^{(n)}$}, are\ntranscendental for all $n \\ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the\nsequences $\\tilde{\\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\\tilde{\\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the\n\"non-alternating analogue\" equation $\\gamma^{(n)} + \\tilde{\\delta}^{(n)}/e =\n\\tilde{\\eta}^{(n)}$."}
