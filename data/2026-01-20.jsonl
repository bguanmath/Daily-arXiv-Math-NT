Likewise, Ramanujan's mock theta functions, originally introduced in his last letter to Hardy, have inspired generations of mathematicians to work on $q$-series and modular forms. In this work, we establish several new identities connecting Ramanujan's continued fractions of order twenty. By employing product representation for Jacobi's theta function $θ_1$, we derive a family of new relations connecting the continued fractions of order twenty with continued fractions of order ten and Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. Further, by expressing Eisenstein series in terms of Lambert series and utilizing certain mock theta functions and their logarithmic derivatives, we obtain beautiful relations between Eisenstein series and theta functions of level twenty. Using Ramanujan's $_1 ψ_1$ summation formula, we establish Eisenstein series identities associated with the continued fractions of order twenty. These results extend earlier work on continued fractions of order 6, 12, and 16 and contribute to theory of $q$-series."}

Solving this problem is an essential step in several recent deterministic algorithms for factoring $N$, including the currently fastest ones. In 2018, the second author gave an algorithm that for a given target order $D \\geq N^{2/5}$, finds either an element of order exceeding $D$, or a nontrivial divisor of $N$, or proves that $N$ is prime. The running time was \\[ O\\left(\\frac{D^{1/2}}{(\\log \\log D)^{1/2}} \\log^2 N \\right) \\] bit operations, asymptotically the same as the cost of computing the order of a single element using Sutherland's optimisation of the classical babystep-giantstep method. Subsequent work by several authors weakened the hypothesis $D \\geq N^{2/5}$ to $D \\geq N^{1/6}$. In this paper, we show that the hypothesis may be dropped altogether. Moreover, if $N$ is prime, we can guarantee returning an element of order exceeding $D$, rather than a proof that $N$ is prime."}

First we construct basic theta operators, labelled by positive roots, that generalize Katz's theta operator for modular forms. Secondly we construct theta linkage maps, these are operators between automorphic vector bundles with linked weights, which can be thought of as generalizations of the classical theta cycle of Tate--Jochnowitz. In particular, there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We explain the relation between the two operators, and we prove some properties about them, e.g., the injectivity of some of them in a generic locus of the $p$-restricted region. As an application, we produce an example of a generic entailment of Serre weights for the groups $GL_{4,\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ and $U(4)_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$, by combining the method of arxiv:2410.09602 with our stronger results about theta operators."}

For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group $G$, we show that invariant $D$-modules of rank $n$ are determined by the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover of $G$: equivalently, their isomorphism classes are classified by $n$-dimensional complex representations of that finite group, up to conjugacy. For a general linear group, we prove that every invariant $D$-module of rank $n$ is obtained by pullback along the determinant map from the one-dimensional torus, so the classification reduces completely to the torus case."}

Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately."}
