In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that\nthe symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family\nare weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the\none-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different\nchoices of weights.

We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters\nfrom the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters.\nMoreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by\nLusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a\nsurprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg\nparameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation."}
