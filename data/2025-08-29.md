Abstract: We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon
f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over
the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a
nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on
the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line
through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate
polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed
hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms
of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field
isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots,
x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to
$F=0$ whenever $q>679$. This improves on a result of Wooley.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial
two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique
decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci
numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the
context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must
respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced
strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.
  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all
$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable
structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n
\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes
is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit
allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a
switching move that reorders pairs.
  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ --
now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.
We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has
length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the
Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic
growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$.
  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit
log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered
Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new
algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into
strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other
recurrence relations.

### [3] [$p$-curvature operators and Satake-type phenomenon for $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ equations with $κ=\pm 2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20270)
*Prakash Belkale,Evgeny Mukhin,Alexander Varchenko*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文研究了sl2 KZ微分方程在参数\kappa=\pm2下的性质，并通过Satake型对应将其与楔形幂空间联系，发现特征p下的KZ方程并非所有解都由p-超几何解生成，这是首个相关实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索\(\frak{sl}_2\) KZ微分方程在特征p下的解的生成情况，特别是在\(\kappa=\pm 2\)时是否所有解都能由已知的p-超几何解生成。

Method: 作者建立了一个Satake型对应（从复数域到有限特征域），通过分析KZ方程的下重量子子空间和对应楔形幂空间的p曲率算子，研究了特征p下的解空间维度和解的生成形式。

Result: 结果表明，当\(\kappa=2\)时，在特征p下并非所有解都可以由p-超几何解生成。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了特征p下的\(\frak{sl}_2\) KZ方程存在由非p-超几何解生成的解，填补了这一领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power
of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered.
A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and
subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the
study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in
terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the
highest weight.
  We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with
our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in
characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the
so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all
solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are
generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Previously, no such examples were
known.

### [4] [A map between arborifications of multiple zeta values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20387)
*Ku-Yu Fan*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The article extends multiple zeta values by defining them through rooted trees, constructing a recursive map to maintain their properties under different algebraic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work addresses a question posed by Manchon on finding a natural map between two BCK Hopf algebras associated with decorated rooted trees, ensuring the commutativity of the diagram relating their non-commutative polynomial algebra representations.

Method: The authors focus on planar rooted trees and develop a recursive approach to construct the necessary map between the two BCK Hopf algebras corresponding to series and integral expressions.

Result: A recursive map is successfully created between the two BCK Hopf algebras for decorated planar rooted trees, proving the commutativity of the diagram within this problem's constraints.

Conclusion: The research provides a positive resolution to Manchon's problem by developing a recursive and natural transformation between BCK Hopf algebras for planar rooted trees, offering insights into the algebraic structures of multiple zeta values and their generalizations.

Abstract: Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values
associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees,
corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon
introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification),
which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees
corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the
non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set
$\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial
algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two
BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we
consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map
between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.

### [5] [Divisibility properties of weighted $k$ regular partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20573)
*Debika Banerjee,Ben Kane*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions, focusing on generating functions and their properties modulo primes. Key findings include Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and conditions under which the function vanishes for positive-density prime sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from extending classical $k$-regular partition functions and exploring their modular properties, particularly to generalize recent results on $5$-regular partitions and uncover deeper structures in weighted partitions.

Method: The authors use q-series, infinite product manipulations, and modular forms to analyze the generating function and derive properties of $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$. They employ techniques like congruence constructions and density analysis of primes.

Result: They prove infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences and congruences modulo prime powers. They also establish positive density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ is divisible by a given prime, with conditions under which it vanishes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that weighted $k$-regular partitions exhibit rich modular structures, generalizing known results. Their approach suggests new directions in partition theory by connecting it to broader arithmetic patterns and prime density conditions.

Abstract: We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 -
q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, \] which extends the classical $k$-regular
partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of
Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime
sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These
results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper
modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.

### [6] [Weyl bound for trilinear periods via conformal bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20576)
*Anshul Adve,James Bonifacio,Petr Kravchuk,Dalimil Mazac,Sridip Pal,Alex Radcliffe,Gordon Rogelberg*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper estimates decay rates of coefficients in the expansion of products of modular forms and provides new instances of the Weyl bound for L-functions using the conformal bootstrap method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of modular forms and their products is fundamental in number theory. Understanding the decay rate of coefficients in their expansions can provide insights into the underlying arithmetic and analytic structures.

Method: The research utilizes the conformal bootstrap technique from physics to analyze the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace eigenbasis. This approach likely involves leveraging symmetry properties and distributional techniques as used in physics.

Result: The paper derives new bounds on the decay of coefficients for the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ when $\Gamma$ is arithmetic, which includes specific cases achieving the Weyl bound for triple product $L$-functions in the spectral aspect.

Conclusion: The application of the conformal bootstrap to number theory, particularly to the spectral analysis of modular forms, reveals new insights into $L$-function bounds. This interdisciplinary perspective may have further implications for both fields.

Abstract: Let $f_1,f_2$ be holomorphic modular forms of the same weight for a cocompact
lattice $\Gamma < \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. We estimate the rate of decay of
the coefficients in the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace
eigenbasis. By specializing our main theorem to the case where $\Gamma$ is
arithmetic, we obtain new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product
$L$-functions in the spectral aspect. Our method builds on the conformal
bootstrap in physics.

### [7] [The lattice packing problem in dimension 9 by Voronoi's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20719)

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing
problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with
optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm
enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed
dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this
enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8.
  In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via
Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice
$\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we
show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$.
Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of
possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91,
99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.

### [8] [On a group of normalized solutions of the higher-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20733)
*Munenori Inagaki,Hideki Matsumura,Masanori Sawa,Yukihiro Uchida*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new group-theoretic structure arising from degree $2$ size $n$ solutions to the $n$-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem and establishes an isomorphism with an orthogonal group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem is a classical and well-studied topic in mathematics, but its connections to group theory, particularly the specific isomorphism with an orthogonal group, have not been previously explored. The motivation is to uncover new algebraic structures and their relationships with number-theoretic objects.

Method: The authors identify and analyze this novel group-theoretic structure directly from the properties of the solutions to the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem. They then construct and prove an explicit isomorphism between this group and the orthogonal group of a specific quadratic form.

Result: This paper demonstrates that a specific group constructed from degree $2$ solutions to the $n$-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem of size $n$ is isomorphic to the corresponding orthogonal group. This provides a new perspective on the algebraic properties of these solutions.

Conclusion: This discovery opens a new direction for research at the intersection of classical number theory and group theory, particularly in understanding how solutions to number-theoretic equations can be leveraged to construct or reveal algebraic groups with known properties and vice versa.

Abstract: We elucidate, for the first time, a novel group-theoretic structure that
arises from certain solutions of the $n$-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott
problem of degree $2$ and size $n$. We prove that the group is isomorphic to
the orthogonal group for a certain quadratic form.

### [9] [An Explicit Tauberian Theorem taking Averaged Inputs with an Application to Counting Abelian Number Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20814)
*Brandon Alberts*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate
of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the
error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed
real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems
with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$
varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters.
This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections
between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions.
  We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation
that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic
expansions. We demonstrate this by proving square root saving error bounds for
the number of $C_n$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of bounded discriminant when
$n=3$, $4$, $8$, $16$, or $2p$ for $p$ an odd prime.

### [10] [Bounds for sets of remainders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20853)
*Omkar Baraskar,Ingrid Vukusic*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper studies the sequence s(n) of distinct remainders n mod k for k ≤ n/2, proving an asymptotic bound for s(n) and showing the difference between consecutive terms is bounded by O(log log n). Additionally, it analysis the iterated remainder sets related to Pierce expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sequence s(n), which counts the number of distinct remainders when n is divided by integers up to n/2, is identified in the OEIS (A283190) but has been surprisingly little studied. The paper is motivated by the desire to understand the asymptotic behavior of s(n) and to prove rigorous bounds on its growth and fluctuations.

Method: The paper employs analytical methods to establish an asymptotic formula for s(n) with an error term of O(n/(log n log log n)). It then investigates the differences between s(n) and s(n+1), using number_theoretic techniques to demonstrate the difference properties. For the iterated remainder sets, the paper draws on the mathematical structure of Pierce expansions and their related problems to derive bounds.

Result: The paper proves that s(n) has an asymptotic bound of c · n + O(n/(log n log log n)) for an explicit constant c, that the differences between s(n) and s(n+1) are bounded in the positive direction by at most one and in the negative direction by O(log log n), and that iterated remainder sets associated with Pierce expansions have their sizes bounded as per a proven mathematical result.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of the remainder sequence s(n) by providing an asymptotic formula and bounds on its consecutive differences and iterated remainder set sizes. It highlights that despite being in the OEIS, this sequence still has many interesting properties waiting to be explored.

Abstract: Let $s(n)$ be the number of different remainders $n \bmod k$, where $1 \leq k
\leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in
the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it
has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n
\log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences
between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can
always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We
show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider
''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce
expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories
arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras
and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded
derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of
rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame
representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop
and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover,
we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of
a ring and the ring's universal localisations.

Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C})$ be a recollement of

$\mathcal{C}$ under suitable conditions. As applications, several related
results are provided to illustrate our construction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We first obtain a trace formula for immanants of generalized principal
submatrix of any complex matrix based on any weight space for finite
dimensional representations of the general linear group. Our trace formula
contains Kostant's famous formula for immanants on $0$-weight spaces as special
case. We then present a criterion for non-vanishing immanants for any
generalized principal submatrix of positive definite Hermitian or nonsingular
totally nonnegative matrices, which strengthened the well-known results of
Schur and Stembridge. Furthermore, we present an inequality that contains
Kostant, Schur and Stembridge's famous inequalities as special cases.
