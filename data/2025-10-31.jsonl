We prove that every\nadelic point on $X$ which is the limit of a sequence of $k$-rational points on\n$A$ is a limit of $k$-rational points on $X$. Assuming finiteness of the\nTate-Shafarevich group of $A$, this implies that the rational points on $X$ are\ndense in the Brauer set of $X$. Similar results are obtained over totally\nimaginary number fields, conditionally on an adelic Mordell-Lang conjecture."}

We\nthen extend their interpolation methods to define big Heegner points attached\nto families of Hilbert modular forms of parallel weight under the weak Heegner\nhypothesis.
