This result is a generalization of one\ngiven by Liping Li in \\cite{LipingLi}.

We show that our construction yields perverse\nsheaves, which coincide with those produced in \\cite{BC24} in an iterated way.\nIn the regular case we establish the compatibility of their Frobenius traces\nwith deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters. As an application, we prove the\npositive-depth Springer's hypothesis for arbitrary characters, thereby\ngeneralizing the generic case result of Chan and Oi \\cite{CO25}. The proofs of\nour results make critical use of the strategies and results from \\cite{BC24}\nand \\cite{Nie_24}."}
