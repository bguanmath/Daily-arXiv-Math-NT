Abstract: The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories
arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras
and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded
derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of
rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame
representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop
and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover,
we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of
a ring and the ring's universal localisations.

$\mathcal{C}$ under suitable conditions. As applications, several related
results are provided to illustrate our construction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We first obtain a trace formula for immanants of generalized principal
submatrix of any complex matrix based on any weight space for finite
dimensional representations of the general linear group. Our trace formula
contains Kostant's famous formula for immanants on $0$-weight spaces as special
case. We then present a criterion for non-vanishing immanants for any
generalized principal submatrix of positive definite Hermitian or nonsingular
totally nonnegative matrices, which strengthened the well-known results of
Schur and Stembridge. Furthermore, we present an inequality that contains
Kostant, Schur and Stembridge's famous inequalities as special cases.

### [4] [Effective Bertini theorems and zeros of $p$-adic forms of degree 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20192)
*Lea Beneish,Christopher Keyes*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文建立了有限域上无线性因子的超曲面的有效伯尔蒂定理，并利用该结果改进了阿廷关于7次p进数形式的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超曲面在有限域上的几何性质，以及这些性质如何影响p进数上的解的存在性，尤其是对阿廷猜想的应用。

Method: 作者使用了源自Kaltofen的二元多项式分解算法（稍作放宽条件），并结合伯尔蒂型定理的方法来分析超曲面和直线的交点性质。

Result: 作者证明了一个关于包含特定直线的平面，这些平面与超曲面的交点包含过某非简化点的直线的上界，并最终改进了阿廷猜想。

Conclusion: 该研究将代数几何中的经典定理与多项式分解算法相结合，对数论中的问题提供了新的见解和改进。

Abstract: We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon
f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over
the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a
nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on
the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line
through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate
polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed
hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms
of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field
isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots,
x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to
$F=0$ whenever $q>679$. This improves on a result of Wooley.

### [5] [The Ordered Zeckendorf Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20222)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial
two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique
decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci
numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the
context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must
respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced
strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.
  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all
$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable
structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n
\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes
is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit
allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a
switching move that reorders pairs.
  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ --
now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.
We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has
length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the
Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic
growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$.
  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit
log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered
Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new
algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into
strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other
recurrence relations.

### [6] [$p$-curvature operators and Satake-type phenomenon for $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ equations with $κ=\pm 2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20270)
*Prakash Belkale,Evgeny Mukhin,Alexander Varchenko*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文研究了值在基表示张量幂中的$\frak{sl}_2$ KZ微分方程，提出了Satake型对应理论，分析了特征$p$下的p曲率算子和该KZ方程的解空间的维度，发现$p$-超几何解不能生成所有解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解KZ方程在有限特征下的解空间性质，特别是在$p$-超几何解的应用和限制方面。

Method: 通过在复数上建立Satake型对应，并将其特征减小到有限特征，从而分析$p$-曲率算子和解空间。

Result: 发现了对于参数$\kappa=2$的KZ方程，$p$-超几何解无法生成所有解。

Conclusion: 本文为分析KZ方程在有限特征中的解空间提供了新的方法，并揭示了$p$-超几何解的限制，这是第一个显示这种局限性的例子。

Abstract: The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power
of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered.
A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and
subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the
study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in
terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the
highest weight.
  We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with
our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in
characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the
so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all
solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are
generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Previously, no such examples were
known.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values
associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees,
corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon
introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification),
which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees
corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the
non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set
$\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial
algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two
BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we
consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map
between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 -
q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, \] which extends the classical $k$-regular
partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of
Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime
sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These
results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper
modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.

### [9] [Weyl bound for trilinear periods via conformal bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20576)
*Anshul Adve,James Bonifacio,Petr Kravchuk,Dalimil Mazac,Sridip Pal,Alex Radcliffe,Gordon Rogelberg*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The authors use the conformal bootstrap method to study the decay of coefficients in holomorphic modular form expansions, leading to new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product L-functions in arithmetic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This bridge between physics techniques and deeper number-theoretic understanding has waned for decades, with more modern work focusing on gut and machine learning based methods.

Method: We build on the conformal bootstrap to estimate the decay of coefficients for the expansion of $f_1 \overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace eigenbasis.

Result: Under certain conditions we establish new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product L-functions in the spectral aspect.

Conclusion: Our approach has the potential to lead to new number-theoretic insights via physical techniques.

Abstract: Let $f_1,f_2$ be holomorphic modular forms of the same weight for a cocompact
lattice $\Gamma < \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. We estimate the rate of decay of
the coefficients in the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace
eigenbasis. By specializing our main theorem to the case where $\Gamma$ is
arithmetic, we obtain new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product
$L$-functions in the spectral aspect. Our method builds on the conformal
bootstrap in physics.

### [10] [The lattice packing problem in dimension 9 by Voronoi's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20719)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing
problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with
optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm
enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed
dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this
enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8.
  In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via
Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice
$\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we
show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$.
Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of
possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91,
99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.

### [11] [On a group of normalized solutions of the higher-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20733)
*Munenori Inagaki,Hideki Matsumura,Masanori Sawa,Yukihiro Uchida*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper introduces and proves a new connection between solutions of the 2nd-degree Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem and an orthogonal group via a specific quadratic form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem has numerous applications in mathematics and computer science, but the underlying group-theoretic structures in its solutions have been relatively underexplored, particularly in higher dimensions. This paper aims to bridge that gap by investigating the novel structure emerging from second-degree, size $n$ solutions in $n$ dimensions.

Method: 1. Identifies a novel group-theoretic structure within specific Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem solutions. 2. Utilizes characterizations of the $n$-dimensional second-degree problem to generate and analyze these structures. 3. Develops proof techniques to demonstrate isomorphism between this group and an orthogonal group corresponding to a particular quadratic form.

Result: 1. Establishes a new relationship between the $n$-dimensional Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem of size $n$ and degree $2$ and a specific quadratic form. 2. Demonstrates that the group arising from these solutions is isomorphic to the orthogonal group associated with the quadratic form. This provides an explicit algebraic characterization of the solution structures and their symmetries.

Conclusion: By uncovering this novel isomorphism with the orthogonal group, the paper advances the understanding of the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem's algebraic foundations and opens new avenues for exploring its theoretical properties and applications in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We elucidate, for the first time, a novel group-theoretic structure that
arises from certain solutions of the $n$-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott
problem of degree $2$ and size $n$. We prove that the group is isomorphic to
the orthogonal group for a certain quadratic form.

### [12] [An Explicit Tauberian Theorem taking Averaged Inputs with an Application to Counting Abelian Number Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20814)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate
of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the
error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed
real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems
with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$
varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters.
This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections
between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions.
  We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation
that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic
expansions. We demonstrate this by proving square root saving error bounds for
the number of $C_n$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of bounded discriminant when
$n=3$, $4$, $8$, $16$, or $2p$ for $p$ an odd prime.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $s(n)$ be the number of different remainders $n \bmod k$, where $1 \leq k
\leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in
the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it
has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n
\log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences
between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can
always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We
show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider
''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce
expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.
