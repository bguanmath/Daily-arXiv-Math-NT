Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$.
When $F$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, Anandavardhanan-Borisagar
and Anandavardhanan-Jana introduced an Iwahori-Hecke model for the universal
supersingular representation $\pi_r$ in the regular case $ 0 < r < q-1$. When
$F=\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, the first author introduced an Iwahori-Hecke model for
$\pi_r$ when $r = 0, p - 1$. We extend this result to an arbitrary local field
$F$ for $r = 0, q - 1$.
  We also write down an explicit non-split self-extension of $\pi_r$ which has
a four-dimensional space of $I(1)$-invariants when $F = \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $r =
0, p-1$.

### [3] [Conditional estimates on the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions with applications to low-lying zeros](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13301)
*Tianyu Zhao*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper uses Beurling-Selberg extremal functions to bound the mean and mean square of the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions to a large prime modulus $q$, under the generalized Riemann hypothesis.  The results are applied to prove the existence of a positive proportion of $L$-functions with zeros close to the central point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the distribution of the zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions, particularly those close to the central point, and to provide alternative proofs for existing results and new bounds.

Method: The paper employs Beurling-Selberg extremal functions to estimate the mean and mean square of the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions.

Result: The paper derives alternative proofs for several results on low-lying zeros of $L(s,\chi)$ and a new lower bound on the proportion of $L(s,\chi)$ modulo $q$ with zeros close to the central point.  Specifically, it shows that for any $\beta > 1/4$, there is a positive proportion of Dirichlet $L$-functions whose first zero has height less than $\beta$ times the average zero spacing.

Conclusion: These results advance the understanding of the distribution of low-lying zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and demonstrate the utility of Beurling-Selberg extremal functions in this area.

Abstract: Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we use Beurling-Selberg extremal
functions to bound the mean and mean square of the argument of Dirichlet
$L$-functions to a large prime modulus $q$. As applications, we give
alternative proofs of several results on low-lying zeros of $L(s,\chi)$ and
obtain a new lower bound on the proportion of $L(s,\chi)$ modulo $q$ with zeros
close to the central point. In particular, we show conditionally that for any
$\beta>1/4$, there exist a positive proportion of Dirichlet $L$-functions whose
first zero has height less than $\beta$ times the average spacing between
consecutive zeros.

### [4] [Subconvex $L^p$-sets, Weyl's inequality, and equidistribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13384)
*Trevor D. Wooley*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper studies subconvex L^p-sets of natural numbers and their properties related to exponential sums and equidistribution of polynomials modulo 1. It demonstrates inequalities akin to Weyl's inequality for these sets and explores their applications in character sums and arithmetic functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding the structure and properties of natural number sets that exhibit subconvex bounds for exponential sums, which can provide deeper insights into their equidistribution and applicability in number-theoretic problems.

Method: The paper involves the analysis of exponential sums over these subconvex L^p-sets and extends Weyl's inequality to their context by examining the equidistribution properties and applying techniques from analytic number theory.

Result: Key results include the establishment of subconvex bounds for exponential sums over such sets, the derivation of new Weyl-type inequalities, and the demonstration of the equidistribution of polynomials with summands restricted to these sets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that subconvex L^p-sets showcase exponential sum properties similar to those established by Weyl's classical inequality, offering powerful tools for addressing various problems involving character sums and averages of arithmetic functions.

Abstract: We examine sets $\mathscr A$ of natural numbers having the property that for
some real number $p\in (0,2)$, one has the subconvex bound $$\int_0^1 \Bigl|
\sum_{n\in \mathscr A\cap [1,N]}e(n\alpha)\Bigr|^p\, {\rm d}\alpha \ll
N^{-1}|\mathscr A\cap [1,N]|^p.$$ We show that exponential sums over such sets
satisfy inequalities analogous to Weyl's inequality, and in many circumstances
of the same strength as classical versions of Weyl's bound. We also examine
equidistribution of polynomials modulo $1$ in which the summands are restricted
to these subconvex $L^p$-sets. In addition, we describe applications to
problems involving character sums and averages of arithmetic functions.

*Alexander E. Patkowski*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Riesz function using the derivative of the Gram series obtained through Riemann-Stieltjes integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the desire to approximate sums over primes.

Method: The authors use the derivative of the Gram series by applying Riemann-Stieltjes integration.

Result: The paper presents a new formula that connects the derivative of the Gram series to the Riesz function and derives general integral relationships.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a novel approach for understanding and working with series involving the M$	oHaveLength function and the Riesz function.

Abstract: We offer some comments on series involving the M$\ddot{o}$bius function which
approximate sums over primes. To accomplish this, we utilize the derivative of
the Gram series by applying Riemann-Stieltjes integration. We offer a new
formula connecting the derivative of the Gram series to the Riesz function,
which we then use to obtain general integral relationships.

Petersson trace formula for the newforms of cubic level, classical Voronoi
summation formula, Jutila's circle method, Kuznetsov trace formula and the
spectral large sieve inequality.

### [7] [Galois module structures and the Hasse principle in twist families via the distribution of Selmer groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14026)
*Alex Bartel,Adam Morgan*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 这篇文章探讨了算术几何中的几个问题：二次扩展下的椭圆曲线Mordell--Weil群的Galois模结构的统计行为，以及属1的双椭圆曲线在二次扭家族中的Hasse原理失败频率，并提出了Kummer manifold的Hasse原理问题。各种问题都涉及到在给定的阿贝尔变体的二次扭家族中的2-Selmer rank的分布结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是研究算术几何中算术性质的表现，尤其是涉及汉尔曼基本（Hasse principle）的问题。这些研究可以帮助理解代数簇的结构和它们的二次扩展的影响，以及其模结构的统计特性。通过得到关于2-Selmer rank的分布结果，可以深入理解这些基本问题的可能性和关系。"

Method: 文章的分析方法是通过特定的二次扭家族中2-Selmer rank的分布来处理这些问题的。该方法利用了对双扭家族的深入研究，以及相关的统计和代数几何工具，从而能够在这些看似分散的问题中揭示了一致的规律和联系。

Result: 主要的结论是，对于二次扩展下的椭圆曲线的Mordell--Weil群的统计分布、双椭圆曲线族的Hasse原理失效频率和Kummer varieties的Hasse原理问题，这些看似不相关的问题都被同一个关于2-Selmer ranks的分布结果联系起来，显示了深刻的统一性。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了算术几何中几个看似不同的问题之间的内在联系，进一步发展了2-Selmer rank及其在二次扭家族中的分布结果的理解。通过这一统一观点，可以展望在更广泛的代数簇中找到类似的现象和解释。

Abstract: We address several seemingly disparate problems in arithmetic geometry: the
statistical behaviour of the Galois module structure of Mordell--Weil groups of
a fixed elliptic curve over varying quadratic extensions; the frequency of
failure of the Hasse principle in quadratic twist families of genus $1$
hyperelliptic curves; and the Hasse principle for Kummer varieties. The common
technical ingredient for all of these is a result on the distribution of
$2$-Selmer ranks in certain sparse families of quadratic twists of a given
abelian variety.

### [8] [Classification of indecomposable states on the infinite symmetric inverse semigroup invariant under the infinite symmetric group. Semifinite case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13760)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{N}$ be a set of the natural numbers.
  Symmetric inverse semigroup $R_\infty$ is the semigroup of all infinite 0-1
matrices $[g_{ij}]$ with at most one 1 in each row and each column such that
$g_{ii}=1$ on the complement of a finite set. The binary operation in
$R_\infty$ is the ordinary matrix multiplication. It is clear that infinite
symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$ is a subgroup of $R_\infty$. The map
$\star:\left[ g_{ij}\right]\mapsto\left[ g_{ji}\right]$ is an involution on
$R_\infty$. We call a function $f$ on $R_\infty$ positive definite if for all
$r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\in R_\infty$ the matrix $\left[ f\left(
r_ir_j^\star\right)\right]$ is Hermitian and positive semi-definite. A function
$f$ said to be indecomposable if the corresponding $\ast$-representation
$\pi_f$ is a factor-representation. A class of the
$\mathfrak{S}_\infty$-invariant functions is defined by the condition
$f(rs)=f(sr)$ for all $r\in R_\infty$ and $s\in\mathfrak{S}_\infty$. In this
paper we classify all semifinite factor-representations of $R_\infty$ that
correspond to the $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$-invariant positive definite functions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the order of the poles of
intertwining operators in the context of the representation theory of general
linear groups over $p$-adic fields. More specifically, we conjecturally relate
the order of the pole to the dimension of a Hom-space associated with
irreducible components of Lusztig's characteristic variety in type $A$. We
verify the conjecture in a wide range of cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed
field $k$, and let $V$ be a vector space on which $G$ acts linearly. The
separating variety $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of
pairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its
geometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e.
sets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of
invariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in
the important special case where $G=\mathrm{GL}_p(\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set
$V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We
define a purely combinatorial poset, $\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal
elements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of
$\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension
$(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular
we show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \geq 3$, or $n \geq 2$ and $p
\geq 4$. In the case $n \geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components
of given codimension in $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of
$\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular
show that when $n\geq 2$ and $p\geq 4$, or $n\geq 3$ and $p=3$,
$\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set.
It was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \geq 4$ and
$p=2$. The author made a conjecture in arXiv:2211.17088 generalising the
Skronowski-Weyman theorem for representations of quivers. The results of this
paper prove that conjecture in two important special cases: for the quiver with
one vertex and an arbitrary number, $n$, of loops, and for the quiver with two
vertices and $n$ arrows between them.

Abstract: Consider a Chevalley group over a finite field $F_q$ such that the longest
element of the Weyl group is central. We construct an involution
$\xi\mapsto\xi^!$ of the set of unipotent representations of this group such
that the degree polynomial of a unipotent representation $\xi$ is obtained up
to sign from the degree polynomial of $\xi^!$ by changing $q$ to $-q$.
