This generalises the\nclassical Cantor sequence into a $p$-automatic sequence for any odd prime $p$.\nTwo main results are then established, both of which play a key role in the\ndisproof of the KPS conjecture.\n  First, the two-dimensional sequence comprised of the Toeplitz determinants of\nthe $p$-Cantor sequence over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is extensively studied. Indeed, the\nso-called profile of this sequence (which encodes the zero regions) is shown to\nbe [p,p]-automatic. In the process of deriving this, the theory of so-called\nnumber walls is developed greatly. Many of these results are stated in full\ngenerality, as the authors expect them to be useful when tackling similar\nproblems going forward.\n  Secondly, a natural process is described that converts number wall of an\nautomatic sequence into a unique fractal. When this sequence is the\naforementioned $p$-Cantor sequence, this fractal is shown to have Hausdorff\ndimension $\\log((p^2+1)/2)/\\log(p).$"}
