For any integers\n$a\\neq0,b\\neq0,k\\geqslant2$, any given complex number $\\eta\\not=0$ and\nmultiplicative function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, we show that \\[\n|\\{n\\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\\eta f(n), n \\text{ square-free }k\\text{-almost\nprime}\\}|\\leqslant \\pi(\\dfrac{X}{L_k})+O(X^{1-\\frac{1}{2k}}) \\] and \\[\n|\\{n\\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\\eta f(n), n \\text{ square-free}\\}|\\leqslant\n\\pi(X)+O(Xe^{-\\sqrt{\\log X}}) \\] as $X\\rightarrow \\infty$. Here, $L_{k}$\ndenotes the product of the first $(k-1)$ primes and $\\pi(X)$ is the number of\nprimes $\\leqslant X$. By providing some examples for which the equality holds,\nwe also prove that these two inequalities are sharp. In particular, these\nestimates imply that $S(a,b;n)\\neq\\eta f(n)$ holds for $100\\%$ square-free\n$k$-almost prime numbers and $100\\%$ square-free numbers $n$.\nCounterintuitively, if $S(a,b;p)=\\eta f(p)$ holds for all but finitely many\nprimes $p$, we further show that \\begin{align*} |\\{n\\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\\eta\nf(n), n \\text{ square-free }k\\text{-almost prime}\\}|\\leqslant\n(|a|+|b|+2k)X^{\\frac{k}{k+1}}+O(1). \\end{align*} All these demonstrate that\n$S(a,b;n)$ with fixed $a\\neq0$ and $b\\neq0$, as an arithmetic function of\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is intrinsically distinct from any complex valued\nmultiplicative function. Similarly, we also show that all these results still\nhold with the Birch sum $B(a,b;n)$ or the Sali\\'e sum $\\widetilde{S}(a,b;n)$ in\nplace of $S(a,b;n)$ if and only if the integer pair $a,b$ satisfies some\nnatural conditions respectively."}

Johnston"], "title": "An effective Bombieri-Vinogradov error term for sifting problems", "comment": "30 pages", "summary": "In number theory, many major results related to the twin prime and Goldbach\nconjectures are proven using the methods of sieve theory. However, in nearly\nevery case, the existing proofs of these results are ineffective, in that\nexplicit values for which they hold cannot be computed. The reason for this\nineffectivity is due to the reliance on the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem. In\nthis paper, we show that any classical sifting problem with a\nBombieri-Vinogradov style error term can in fact be made effective, with no\nloss to the asymptotic form of the original (ineffective) result. This is done\nby carefully modifying the sieve upper and lower bounds as to avoid the usual\ncomplications regarding the existence of a Siegel zero. We also provide some\nsimple applications. For example, we show that one may effectively bound the\nnumber of primes $p\\leq x$ such that $p+2$ is also prime by \\begin{equation*}\n(4+o(1))C_2\\frac{x}{(\\log x)^2}, \\end{equation*} where \\begin{equation*}\nC_2=2\\prod_{p>2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) \\end{equation*} is the\ntwin-prime constant."}
