Abstract: We present a new systematic method for evaluating generalized log-sine
integrals in terms of polylogarithms. Our approach is based on an identity
connecting ordinary generating functions of polylogarithms to integrals
involving the sine function. This method provides closed-form expressions for
log-sine integrals of weight up to 4 using only classical polylogarithms, while
higher weights require Nielsen polylogarithms. Later we generalize this
identity and show how it gives rise to numerous Ap\'ery-like formulae extending
results of Koecher, Leshchiner and others. We also derive hyperbolic analogues
and recover several functional equations between Nielsen polylogarithms. In the
process, we derive new parametric identities similar to those given by Saha and
Sinha.

Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field of a curve in characteristic zero or a number
field over which the $abc$-conjecture holds, fix $\alpha\in K$, and let
$f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$ for some $d\geq2$ and some $c\in K$. Then for many $c$ and
$d$, we prove that $f_{d,c}^n(x)-\alpha$ has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for
all $n\geq1$. For example, when $\alpha=0$ we prove that the set \[\Big\{d\,:\,
f_{d,c}^n(x)\;\text{has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$ and all
$h(c)>0$}\Big\}\] has positive asymptotic density. We then apply this result to
compute the density of prime divisors in certain forward orbits and to
establish the finiteness of integral points in certain backward orbits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For an $S$-valued function $f$ of $m \geq 1$ variables we define a dynamical
process in which the output $f(\overline{v})$ replaces exactly one entry of the
input $\overline{v} \in S^m$ at each step in the iterative process. Our study
focuses on periodic vectors with respect to this process. We define a
stratification of periodic vectors according to their type, and characterize
types for which the determination of periodic vectors comes down to dynamics of
univariate polynomials. We then restrict to the case of a diagonal binary
quadratic form $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and classify rational periodic vectors
for all types of period up to $5$. This includes two types which do not arise
from the univariate case.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced a new infinite family of
partition functions called generalized cubic partitions. Given a positive
integer $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$
in which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored.
These partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic
partitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist
in the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers,
and Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various
$d \geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this
paper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More
specifically, our main theorem asserts \[a_3\left(5^{2\alpha}n +\gamma_{\alpha}
\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{5^\alpha},\] where \[\gamma_{\alpha} = 20 + \frac{19
\cdot 25 (25^{\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.\] In order to prove these congruences, we use
an approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson
and Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$.
However, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our
modular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we
utilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot,
which is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular
curves, such as $X_0(10).$

Abstract: Let $K/F$ be a CM extension satisfying the ordinary assumption for an odd

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boyd-Lawton定理在Mahler测度的多变量极限已被Brunault等推广，而Issa和Lalín则将其推广到单变量的多种Mahler测度扩展。

Method: 作者探讨了将单变量的Boyd-Lawton定理推广到多变量的不同方式。

Result: 他们建立了一个统一框架，并有效地推广了Boyd-Lawton定理的工作。

Conclusion: 这种通用框架有助于更好地理解和扩展Boyd-Lawton定理。

Abstract: The classical Boyd-Lawton theorem concerning Mahler measures has recently
been extended to multivariable limits by Brunault, Guilloux, Mehrabdollahei,
and Pengo. In another direction, the single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorem has
been generalized to various extensions of Mahler measure by Issa and Lal\'in.
The goal of this paper is to present a cohesive framework for extending
single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorems to multivariable Boyd-Lawton theorems.
With this, we broaden the single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorems of Issa and
Lal\'in to multivariable versions in the direction of Brunault, Guilloux,
Mehrabdollahei, and Pengo, providing a generalization of both works.

Abstract: Let $b\geq 2$ be an integer. We call an integer $k$ a $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski
number if $\gcd(k+1,b-1)=1$ and $k\cdot b^n+1$ is composite for all positive
integers $n$. We similarly call $k$ a $b$-Riesel number if $\gcd(k-1,b-1)=1$
and $k\cdot b^n-1$ is composite for all positive integers $n$. An integer that
is simultaneously $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski and $b$-Riesel is called a $b$-Brier
number. In this article, we show that for any integer $\alpha\neq 0$, there are
infinitely many $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski numbers and infinitely many $b$-Riesel
numbers of the form $tb^t+\alpha$. We further show that when $b+1$ is not a
power of $2$, there are infinitely $b$-Brier number of this form.

### [8] [The dimension of particular $p$-primary torsion subgroups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05966)
*Giulia Pelizzari,James Punch*

TL;DR: This paper refines bounds for the functions $G$, $H$, and $\Phi$ in the context of CM abelian varieties over specific infinite extensions of $p$-adic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of bounds on these functions is important for understanding the dimensions of $p$-primary torsion subgroups within Mordell--Weil groups, particularly for CM abelian varieties.

Method: The authors build upon previous work by Silverberg (1992) and Ozeki (2024), suggesting they refined existing techniques or introduced new approaches to enhance the bounds for $G$, $H$, and $\Phi$.

Result: Improved bounds for the functions $G$, $H$, and $\Phi$ were established, contributing to a deeper understanding of the $p$-primary torsion subgroups in Mordell--Weil groups of CM abelian varieties.

Conclusion: The refined bounds offer more precise estimates for the dimensions of $p$-primary torsion subgroups in the specified context, potentially influencing future studies in this area of number theory and algebraic geometry.

Abstract: In this paper we improve upon bounds on the functions $G$ and $H$, due to
(Silverberg, 1992), and the function $\Phi$, due to (Ozeki, 2024). These
functions are of interest in the study of the dimension of $p$-primary torsion
subgroups of Mordell--Weil groups of CM abelian varieties over certain infinite
extensions of $p$-adic fields.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $\omega(n)$ denotes
the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is
an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and
$k\in\mathbb{N}$, \[\#\{n\le x\colon\omega(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log
x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.\] A myriad of generalizations and variations of this
inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version
of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of
Hal\'asz and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its
applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of
$\omega$ on subsets of integers, the Erd\H{o}s multiplication table problem,
divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $\lambda$-function.
Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the
normal order of $\omega(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$,
confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992
conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $L$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$ with a fixed algebraic
closure $\overline{L}$, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in L$. For an integer
$d\ge 2$, we consider the family of polynomials $f_{\lambda}(z) :=
z^d+\lambda$, parameterized by $\lambda\in\overline{L}$. Define
$C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ to be the set of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ for
which there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
$f_{\lambda}^m(\alpha_1)=f_{\lambda}^n(\alpha_2)=\beta$. In other words,
$C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ consists of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ with the
property that the orbit of $\alpha_1$ collides with the orbit of $\alpha_2$
under the same polynomial $f_{\lambda}$ precisely at the point $\beta$.
Assuming $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta$ are not all contained in a finite subfield
of $L$, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which
$C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ is infinite. We also discuss the remaining case
where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in \overline{\mathbb F}_p$ and provide ample
computational data that suggest a somewhat surprising conjecture. Our problem
fits into a long series of questions in the area of unlikely intersections in
arithmetic dynamics, which have been primarily studied over fields of
characteristic $0$. Working in characteristic $p$ adds significant
difficulties, but also reveals the subtlety of our problem, especially when
some of the points lie in a finite field or when $d$ is a power of $p$.

Method: 作者通过深入分析Hecke-Maaß尖点形式在$

H^3$上的性质，并运用数论和调和分析相结合的方法，推导出其联合值的等分分布。这可能包括对形式的功能方程、傅里叶系数和相关算子的谱收敛性质的探讨。

Result: 结果表明，对于$

H^3$上的Hecke-Maaß尖点形式，它们的联合值呈现出等分分布的特性。这种分布在正交尖点形式中体现了可预测的统计规律性，特别是在多个独立的Hecke-Maaß尖点形式的同时作用下，其值在$

H^3$上的分布趋于均匀。

Conclusion: 该研究发现不仅证实了Hecke-Maaß尖点形式在三维双曲空间上的联合值等分分布，而且为正交尖点形式的统计独立性猜想提供了数学基础，深数论与分析数论的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We prove a joint value equidistribution statement for Hecke-Maa{\ss} cusp

Motivation: 扩展Niven定理的应用边界，希望通过研究已有结果的基础上深入探讨，把对cos、sin的研究推广到tan，同时从Galois理论角度对结果加以证明和理解。

Method: 首先使用初等数学方法解决余弦和正弦的幂次结果分类问题，继而运用代数数论分析正切情况，最后通过Galois理论提供更深入的概念性解释。

Result: 得到了cos、sin、tan在有理数角度下的幂次结果为有理数时的全部元素的分类。

Conclusion: 通过不同数学方法的协同使用，深化对三角函数有理数特性及其幂次情况的全面理解，为相关领域研究提供了理论支持和创造性思路。

Abstract: Niven's Theorem asserts that $\{\cos(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}\}\cap\mathbb{Q} =
\{0, \pm 1, \pm\frac{1}{2}\}$. This paper uses elementary methods to classify
all elements in the sets $\{\cos^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in
\mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$ and $\{\sin^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in
\mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Using some algebraic number theory, we extend this
to a classification of all elements in $\{\tan^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in
\mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Finally, we present a short Galois theoretic
argument to provide a more conceptual understanding of the results.

Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field. Let $\pi_1,\pi_2$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic

$GL_3(\mathbb{A}_F)$. When $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is of general type, we show that
the triple product $L$-function $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ on either
$GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(2)$ or $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(3)$ has no
Siegel zero. Moreover, when $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is not of general type, we give
precise conditions when $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ could possibly
have Siegel zeros.

### [14] [Rough numbers between consecutive primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06463)
*Ayla Gafni,Terence Tao*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper proves that almost all prime gaps contain a number whose smallest prime factor is at least the gap length, and provides bounds for the number of exceptional gaps based on the Erdse conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confirming a prediction by Erds regarding the distribution of numbers within prime gaps. 

Method: Using a sieve-theoretic argument and asymptotics for singular series developed by Montgomery and Soundararajan.

Result: The number of exceptional prime gaps with $p_n \in [X,2X]$ is at most $O(X/	ext{log}^2 X)$, with a more precise asymptotic bound under the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.

Conclusion: The results confirm Erds' prediction with a significant bound, possibly extending to understanding the distribution of primes more intimately subject to conjectures on singular series asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: Using a sieve-theoretic argument, we show that almost all gaps $(p_n,
p_{n+1})$ between consecutive primes $p_n, p_{n+1}$ contain a natural number
$m$ whose least prime factor $p(m)$ is at least the length $p_{n+1} - p_n$ of
the gap, confirming a prediction of Erd\H{o}s. In fact the number $N(X)$ of
exceptional gaps with $p_n \in [X,2X]$ is shown to be at most $O(X/\log^2 X)$.
Assuming a form of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuples conjecture, we establish
a more precise asymptotic $N(X) \sim c X / \log^2 X$ for an explicit constant
$c>0$, which we believe to be between $2.7$ and $2.8$. To obtain our results in
their full strength we rely on the asymptotics for singular series developed by
Montgomery and Soundararajan.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, a general setting is proposed to define a class of modules
over nonsemisimple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ induced by a nonperfect ideal
$\mathfrak{p}$. This class of Lie algebras includes many well-known Lie
algebras, and some of this class of modules are Whittaker modules and others
are not. We call these modules quasi-Whittaker modules. By introducing a new
concept: the Whittaker annihilator for universal quasi-Whittaker modules, we
are able to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
irreducibility of the universal quasi-Whittaker modules. In the reducible case,
we can obtain some maximal submodules. In particular, we classify the
irreducible quasi-Whittaker modules for many Lie algebras, and obtain a lot of
irreducible smooth $\mathcal{W}_n^+$-modules of height $2$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-commutative version of strongly flat
modules, which is based on the concept of universal localization introduced by
Cohn. We consider a set $\sigma$ consisting of maps of finitely generated
projective $R$-modules, where $R$ is not necessarily a commutative ring. Let
$R_{\sigma}$ denote the universal localization of $R$ with respect to $\sigma$.
The class of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules is defined as the left class in the
cotorsion pair generated by $R_{\sigma}$. We examine the homotopy category of
$\sigma$-strongly flat modules and demonstrate that the thick subcategory
$\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$, consisting of acyclic complexes, wherein all syzygies
are $\sigma$-strongly flat, forms a precovering class within this homotopy
category. This implies that the quotient map from
$\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})$ to
$\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})/\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$ always has a
fully faithful right adjoint.
