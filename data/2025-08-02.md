Abstract: We investigate the densities of the sets of abundant numbers and of covering
numbers, integers $n$ for which there exists a distinct covering system where
every modulus divides $n$. We establish that the set $\mathcal{C}$ of covering
numbers possesses a natural density $d(\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 <
d(\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend
and Del\'eglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a
function $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering
number with the property that $c(n) \leq h(n) = \sigma(n)/n$. However,
computing $d(\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to
simplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain
significantly improved bounds for $d(\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant
numbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$. We also show the
count of primitive covering numbers up to $x$ is $O\left(
x\exp\left(\left(-\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{\log 2}} + \epsilon\right)\sqrt{\log x} \log
\log x\right)\right)$, which is substantially smaller than the corresponding
bound for primitive abundant numbers.

### [2] [Nonzero $\mathfrak{n}$ cohomology of Totally Degenerate Limit of Discrete Series representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23102)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that a totally degenerate limit of discrete series representation
admits a choice of n cohomology group that is nonvanishing at a canonically
defined degree. We then show that the combinatorial complexes used by Soergel
to compute these cohomology groups satisfies Serre duality. We conclude that
this produces two n cohomology groups, each for a totally degenerate limit of
discrete series of U(n+1) and U(n), which are nonvanishing at the same degree.
This suggests Gan Gross Prasad type branching laws for the TDLDS of unitary
groups of any rank.

### [3] [Cyclotomy, cyclotomic cosets and arimetic propeties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23179)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle
x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are obtained by using the cyclotomic classes of order 2
with respect to $n=p^sq^t$, where $p\equiv3 \mathrm{mod} 4$,
$\gcd(\phi(p^s),\phi(q^t))=2$, $l$ is a primitive root modulo $q^t$ and
$\mathrm{ord}_{p^s}(l)=\phi(p^s)/2$. The form of these cyclotomic classes
enables us to further generalize the results obtained in \cite{ref1}. The
explicit expressions of primitive idempotents of minimal ideals in
$\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are also obtained.

### [4] [Extending bounds on minimal ranks of universal quadratic lattices to larger number fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23338)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: There exist numerous results in the literature proving that within certain
families of totally real number fields, the minimal rank of a universal
quadratic lattice over such a field can be arbitrarily large. Kala introduced a
technique of extending such results to larger fields -- e.g. from quadratic
fields to fields of arbitrary even degree -- under some conditions. We present
improvements to this technique by investigating the structure of subfields
within composita of number fields, using basic Galois theory to translate this
into a group-theoretic problem. In particular, we show that if totally real
number fields with minimal rank of a universal lattice $\geq r$ exist in degree
$d$, then they also exist in degree $kd$ for all $k\geq3$.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a special class of multiple Dirichlet series whose terms are
supported on a variety and which admit an Euler product structure. We show that
these series arise naturally from twisted moments of automorphic \( L
\)-functions associated with Dirichlet twists. We proposed several conjectures
on the analytic properties of these series.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let ${\pmb b}=\{b_0,\,b_1,\,\ldots\}$ be the known sequence of numbers such
that $b_0\neq0$. In this work, we develop methods to find another sequence
${\pmb a}=\{a_0,\,a_1,\,\ldots\}$ that is related to ${\pmb b}$ as follows:
$a_n=a_0\,b_{n+m}+a_1\,b_{n+m-1}+\ldots+a_{n+m}\,b_0$,
$n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, $m\in\mathbb{N}$. We show the connection of
$\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$ with $a_0,\,a_1,\,\ldots,\,a_{m-1}$ and provide varied
examples of finding the sequence ${\pmb a}$ when ${\pmb b}$ is given. We
demonstrate that the sequences ${\pmb a}$ may exhibit pretty patterns in the
plane or space. Also, we show that the properly chosen sequence ${\pmb b}$ may
define ${\pmb a}$ as some famous sequences, such as the partial sums of the
Riemann zeta function, etc.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explicitly compute the McKay quivers of small finite subgroups of
$GL(2,\mathbb{C})$ relative to the natural representation, using character
theory and the McKay quivers of finite subgroups of $SU(2)$. We present
examples that shows the rich symmetry and combinatorial structure of these
quivers. We compare our results with the MacKay quivers computed by Auslander
and Reiten.
