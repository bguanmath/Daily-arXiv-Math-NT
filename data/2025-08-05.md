Abstract: The characterization of permutations over finite fields is an important topic
in number theory with a long-standing history. This paper presents a systematic
investigation of low-degree bivariate polynomial systems
$F=(f_1(x,y),f_2(x,y))$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$. Specifically, we
employ Hermite's Criterion to completely classify bivariate quadratic
permutation polynomial systems, while utilizing the theory of permutation
rational functions to give a full classification of bivariate 3-homogeneous
permutation polynomial systems. Furthermore, as an application of our findings,
we provide an explicit characterization of the permutation binomials of the
form $x^3+ax^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with characteristic $p\neq3$,
thereby resolving a significant special case within this classical research
domain.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this note, we consider Szemer\'{e}di's theorem on $k$-term arithmetic
progressions over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, where the allowed set $S$ of
common differences in these progressions is chosen randomly of fixed size.
Combining a generalization of an argument of Altman with Moshkovitz--Zhu's
bounds for the partition rank of a tensor in terms of its analytic rank, we
(slightly) improve the best known lower bounds (due to Bri\"et) on the size
$|S|$ required for Szemer\'edi's theorem with difference in $S$ to hold
asymptotically almost surely.

Abstract: Many authors have recently studied the degenerate harmonic numbers. This
paper makes two main contributions. First, we derive several explicit
expressions for these numbers, which are a degenerate version of the ordinary
harmonic numbers. We also examine the degenerate harmonic numbers of order m
and find an expression for them. Second, we investigate some related numbers
that are closely connected to the degenerate harmonic numbers of order m, which
reduce to the degenerate harmonic numbers when m=1

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given an increasing integer sequence $(a_n)$, a real number $\alpha$, and a
sequence $\psi(n)$, we study the set $W$ of real numbers $\gamma$ for which
$a_n\alpha - \gamma$ is a distance less than $\psi(n)$ away from an integer.
This is often referred to as twisted Diophantine approximation, in this case
with denominators restricted to the given sequence $(a_n)$. Our main results
are about the size of $W$, and they hold for almost every $\alpha$, with
respect to a measure of positive Fourier dimension, for example Lebesgue
measure. Our results extend recent work of Kristensen and Persson, and answer
questions that they posed.

Abstract: Recently, Keith investigated reciprocals of false theta functions and proved

combinatorial identities. At the end of his paper, Keith posed a conjecture on
congruences modulo 4 and 8 for the coefficients of the reciprocal of a false
theta function. In this paper, we not only confirm Keith's conjecture, but also
prove a generalized result.

Motivation: This paper explores the heart of anabelian geometry, highlighting the collaborative international efforts, particularly with the Japanese arithmetic school, and aims to demonstrate the universality of the homotopic method in arithmetic geometry.

Method: The paper begins with elementary examples to introduce motivations and guiding principles, followed by a presentation of key results and contemporary trends in the theory.

Result: The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of anabelian geometry, showing its rich and diverse mathematical landscape that spans number theory to topology.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the study of anabelian geometry illustrates profound connections between number theory, geometry, and topology through the lens of symmetries.

Abstract: ``Can number and geometric spaces be reconstructed from their symmetries?''
This question, which is at the heart of anabelian geometry, a theory built on
the collaborative efforts of an international community in many variants and
with the Japanese arithmetic school as a core, illustrates, in the case of a
positive answer, the universality of the homotopic method in arithmetic
geometry. Starting with elementary examples, we first introduce the motivations
and guiding principles of the theory, then present its most structuring results
and its contemporary trends. As a result, the reader is presented with a rich
and diverse landscape of mathematics, which thrives on theoretical and explicit
methods, and runs from number theory to topology.

Method: The approach employs generalizing the zero-one law by incorporating arbitrary weight functions, providing a streamlined proof through the transference principle, and describing the sets of matrices and Dirichlet pairs from a Lebesgue measure perspective.

Result: This paper derives a metrical description of the sets of $g$-Dirichlet pairs and a characterization of bad approximability using inhomogeneous approximations. The new proof and generalization under weighted Diophantine approximations yield enhanced understanding and versatile quantitative results.

Conclusion: The study successfully generalizes the zero-one law and offers a novel, simplified proof using the transference principle, contributing a deeper understanding of Diophantine approximation metrics and their applications to bad approximability.

Abstract: In [Compositio Math. 155 (2019)] Kleinbock and Wadleigh proved a "zero-one
law" for uniform inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations. We generalize this
statement with arbitrary weight functions and establish a new and simple proof
of this statement, based on transference principle. We also give a complete
description of the sets of $g$-Dirichlet pairs with a fixed matrix in this
setup from Lebesgue measure point of view. As an application, we consider the
set of badly approximable matrices and give a characterization of bad
approximability in terms of inhomogeneous approximations. All the
aforementioned metrical descriptions work (and sometimes can be strengthened)
for weighted Diophantine approximations.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to use a cluster-theoretical approach to solve Diophantine equations, providing a new method for obtaining solutions through mutations starting from initial solutions.

Method: The paper establishes a framework linking cluster theory and Diophantine equations by studying cluster symmetry. It derives necessary and sufficient conditions for Laurent polynomials to be invariant under a given cluster symmetric map and constructs a discriminant algorithm to check if a Laurent polynomial can admit a cluster symmetric pair and be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.

Result: The results include solving two specific Diophantine equations, describing three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolving two problems posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and providing two Matlab programs for constructing invariants and finding cluster symmetric pairs.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the proposed framework successfully connects cluster theory with Diophantine equations, offering new insights and effective tools for solving such equations using cluster symmetry and mutations.

Abstract: This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of
Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial
solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine
equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the
necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant
under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a
discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent
polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a
generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations,
describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two
questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two
Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials
and finding cluster symmetric pairs.

### [10] [An explicit parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02040)
*Ryota Umezawa*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper provides an explicit formula for the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms, building on the proofs by E. Panzer and recent work by M. Hirose on multiple zeta values. The previous understanding of this theorem had limitations when it came to more complex scenarios, and the authors contribute to making the theorem more applicable and explicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by the limitations of E. Panzer's 2017 constructive proof of the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms, which did not offer a general explicit formula. Being inspired by M. Hirose's recent explicit formula for the parity theorem in multiple zeta values, they aim to provide a similar, but extendable, understanding for multiple polylogarithms.

Method: The authors have followed the approach inspired by M. Hirose's work. They constructed an explicit formula to address the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms, detailing the necessary steps and mathematical boundaries that cover broader application cases.

Result: They achieved a direct and explicit formulation of the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms, which improves upon the previous understanding by offering a formula that can be directly applied in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The explicit formula provided by the paper for the parity theorem in multiple polylogarithms expands on existing research, enhancing the theorem's versatility and applicability for further studies in the field.

Abstract: In 2017, E. Panzer proved the parity theorem for multiple polylogarithms.
While his proof is simple and constructive, it does not yield a general
explicit formula. Inspired by M. Hirose's recent work on the parity theorem for
multiple zeta values, this paper presents an explicit formula for the parity
theorem for multiple polylogarithms.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We will provide a new type of zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ when
$\sigma$ is sufficiently close to $1$. In particular, we will show that
$N(\sigma,T)$ can be bounded by an absolute constant when $\sigma$ is
sufficiently close to the left edge of the Korobov-Vinogradov zero-free region.
As a consequence, we provide the optimal error term in the prime number theorem
of the form $$ \psi(x)-x \ll x\exp \left\{-(1-\varepsilon)
\omega(x)\right\},\qquad \omega(x):=\min _{t \geq 1}\{\nu(t) \log x+\log t\},
$$ where $\nu(t)=A_0(\log t)^{-2/3}(\log\log t)^{-1/3}$ is a decreasing
function such that $\zeta(\sigma+it)\neq 0$ for $\sigma\ge 1-\nu(t)$.
Precisely, we will show that we can take $\varepsilon=0$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: describe the motivation in this paper

Method: method of this paper

Result: result of this paper

Conclusion: conclusion of this paper

Abstract: We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of
multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via
$\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can
extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a
number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has
interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute
convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic
continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet
$L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we
show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic
Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $K:k$ be a field extension and let $\Lambda$ be a finite-dimensional
$k$-algebra. We investigate the relationship between $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_K =
\Lambda \otimes_k K$ with particular emphasis on various aspects of
$\tau$-tilting theory and bricks. We show that many types of objects for
$\Lambda$ lift injectively to the same type of object for $\Lambda_K$, and many
common constructions in $\tau$-tilting theory commute with the process of
extending the base field. One of our main applications is the construction of a
faithful functor from the $\tau$-cluster morphism category
$\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ of $\Lambda$ to the $\tau$-cluster morphism category
$\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda_K)$ of $\Lambda_K$. In particular, this establishes a
faithful functor from $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ to a group whenever $k$ is of
characteristic zero which has many important consequences. In the appendix, E.
J. Hanson shows the analogous result whenever $k$ is a finite field. Moreover,
we give some nontrivial examples to illustrate the behaviour of $\tau$-tilting
finiteness under base field extension.

### [17] [Semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf II: the Ran space version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01527)
*Gurbir Dhillon,Sergey Lysenko*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper continues the study from arXiv:2310.0638, focusing on the definition and analysis of the parabolic semi-infinite category on the Ran version of the affine Grassmanian. It examines the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf, offering multiple descriptions and relating global and local semi-infinite categories as well as the intersection cohomology sheaf of the Drinfeld compactification of Bun_P to the IC-sheaf.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the previous work on the Ran version of the affine Grassmanian by introducing and analyzing the parabolic semi-infinite category and its associated IC-sheaf, which is essential for understanding the geometric and categorical structures in this context.

Method: The authors define the parabolic semi-infinite category on Gr_{G,Ran} and provide different characterizations of the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf, including a colimit description and an intermediate extension approach. They also explore the relationship between global and local semi-infinite categories and connect the IC-sheaf with the Drinfeld compactification of Bun_P.

Result: The paper successfully defines and investigates the parabolic semi-infinite category and its IC-sheaf, establishing connections to both local and global structures as well as the Drinfeld compactification of Bun_P. Multiple descriptions of the IC-sheaf are provided, enhancing understanding of its properties.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of semi-infinite categories and IC-sheaves in the context of the affine Grassmanian. The connections established with the Drinfeld compactification and the relationships between different semi-infinite categories suggest further insights into the geometric Langlands program.

Abstract: This paper is a sequel to arXiv:2310.0638. Let G be a split reductive group.
We define the parabolic semi-infinite category on the Ran version of the affine
Grassmanian Gr_{G,Ran}. We study the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf in this
category. We provide several descriptions of this object, one as certain
colimit, another as an intermediate extension in certain category. We relate
the global and local semi-infinite categories of sheaves. We also relate the
intersection cohomology sheaf of the Drinfeld compactification of Bun_P with
the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf.

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes minimal representations of exceptional real groups with split rank 4, focusing on their restriction to dual pairs involving $G_2$ and split rank one groups, leading to key findings about representation correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how minimal representations behave when restricted to dual pairs is important for uncovering deeper relationships between these groups and their representation theories.

Method: The authors specifically restrict the minimal representation of the quaternionic group to the dual pair $G 	imes G'$ and conduct detailed analysis.

Result: They derive significant results for the representation correspondence induced by this restriction.

Conclusion: The work contributes to the broader understanding of minimal representations within the context of exceptional real groups and their dual pairs.

Abstract: Exceptional real groups have quaternionic forms of split rank 4 that contain
dual pairs $G\times G'$, where $G'$ is the split Lie group of the type $G_2$,
and $G$ a Lie group of split rank one. In this paper we restrict the minimal
representation of the quaternionic group to the dual pair and prove some
significant results for the resulting correspondence of representations.

*Pierre Clare,Nigel Higson,Angel Román*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper describes the construction of an embedding for the C*-algebra of a Cartan motion group into G's reduced C*-algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to continue the work of the last two authors from several years ago on complex groups to the case of real reductive groups.

Method: The method involves constructing an explicit embedding of the C*-algebra from the Cartan motion group into the reduced C*-algebra of the original group G.

Result: The embedding allows characterizing the Mackey bijection, a continuous field of C*-algebras, and the Connes-Kasparov assembly map.

Conclusion: The paper successfully expands previous findings on complex groups to the real case in operator K-theory.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is construct an embedding of the C*-algebra of the
Cartan motion group of a real reductive group G into the reduced C*-algebra of
G itself. The embedding has a number of applications: we shall use it to
characterize the Mackey bijection from the tempered dual of G into the unitary
dual of the motion group; to characterize the continuous field of reduced group
C*-algebras arising from the contraction of G to its Cartan motion group; and
to characterize the Connes-Kasparov assembly map in operator K-theory. Our
results continue and complete a project that was begun several years ago by the
last two authors, who considered the case of complex groups. In the real case,
detailed information from the theory of R-groups is used in the construction.
