This result expands upon previous work with Radchenko in which such identities were found for divisor functions with even integer index \\cite{FKLR} and encompasses results of Jacobi \\cite{motohashi1994binary} and Diamantis and O'Sullivan in \\cite{diamantis2010kernels, o2023identities} for divisor functions with odd integer index. The proof of our result expresses these sums in terms of Estermann zeta functions and uses trace formulae. In addition, we use a regularization of divergent convolution sums to provide a mathematical explanation for $L$-values (non-critical in the sense of Deligne) appearing in modular graph functions \\cite{DKS2021_2}."}

This paper further investigates permutation polynomials of such form over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$. Unlike previous studies, we transform the problem of constructing univariate permutation polynomials over finite fields into that of constructing corresponding multivariate permutations over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-vector spaces. Through this approach, we completely characterize a class of permutation polynomials of the form $L(X)+γTr_q^{q^3}(c_1X+c_2X^2+c_3X^3+c_4X^{q+2})$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$, where $q=2^m$, $L(X)=X^q+aX$ and $a,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,γ\\in\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $a^2+a+1\\neq0$.

In particular we focus on representations on $\\operatorname{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\\mathcal{O}$ such that $\\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.\n  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.\n  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above."}
