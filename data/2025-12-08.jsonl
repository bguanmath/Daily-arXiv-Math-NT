Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus.\n  Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it."}

For a local field F of characteristic zero, we prove that the sequence ([αx^n]) is uniformly distributed in the valuation ring O for almost every x with |x|_p>1. In the case of positive characteristic, ([x^n]) fails to be uniformly distributed, but it becomes μ*-uniformly distributed for some weighted measure μ*. These results are derived from a general metric theorem for sequences generated by expanding scaling maps. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the exceptional set of parameters x for which these sequences are not uniformly distributed is large (i.e. having full Hausdorff dimension) and share a rich q-homogeneous fractal structure."}
