Cook"], "title": "Vanishing Cohomology of Dominant Line Bundles for Real Groups", "comment": "13 pages. Comments welcomed", "summary": "In \\cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a\ngeneralization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$\nis adjoint. More specifically, if $\\mathcal{N}_\\theta$ denotes the cone of\nnilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar\nconstruction of a resolution of singularities $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{N}_\\theta}.$\nWe prove that for a certain cone of weights\n$H^i(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{N}_\\theta},\\mathcal{O}_{\\widetilde{\\mathcal{N}_\\theta}}(\\lambda))=0$\nfor $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical\nbundle for $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{N}_\\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemanshneider\nvanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2),\n$\\mathbb{C}[\\mathcal{N}_\\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a\ncertain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in\n\\cite{KostantRallis1971}."}

In the case when $\\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra\n$\\mathcal{P}_k(\\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting\non the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\\geq\n2k$. The algebra $\\mathcal{P}_k(\\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of\n$\\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as\nthe centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given\nby an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the\nway, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook\nmonoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions\nare given by generalized Bell numbers."}
