Comments welcome!", "summary": "We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal\nalgebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the\ncontext of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both\nphysical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded\nLie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and\none of its subalgebras, which we call $\\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of\nwell-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. After showing\nthat such modules are free or ``almost free'', we go through some structure\ntheory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the\nalgebra which lets us construct BCCA-modules intrinsically. In particular, we\nconstruct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\\mathcal{O}$ and\nprove criteria for their irreducibility."}

There is extensive evidence supporting\nthis conjecture for many families, including the family of holomorphic cusp\nnewforms. Interestingly, there are very few choices for the main term of the\nlimiting behavior. In 2009, S. J. Miller computed lower-order terms for the\n1-level density of families of elliptic curve $L$-functions and compared to\ncuspidal newforms of prime level; while the main terms agreed, the lower order\nterms depended on the arithmetic of the family. We extend his work by\nidentifying family-dependent lower-order correction terms in the weighted\n1-level and 2-level densities of holomorphic cusp newforms up to\n$O\\left(1/\\log^4 R\\right)$ error, sharpening Miller's $O\\left(1/\\log^3\nR\\right)$ error.
