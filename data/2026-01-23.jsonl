The oligomorphic group $\\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties.\n  In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $Ψ\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{D}$. The category $\\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field).\n  Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $Ψ$, and a previously constructed functor $Φ\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope."}

We obtain along the way a generalisation of the Stone-von Neumann theorem to the $\\ell$-modular setting, together with the Weil representation with coefficients in $R$ on the $R$-metaplectic group.

Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family.\n  Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points.

Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics.
