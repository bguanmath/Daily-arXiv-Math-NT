For general linear Lie superalgebras, the Kac--Wakimoto character formula is regarded as a good character formula for a certain class of ``singular'' weights (the so-called Kac--Wakimoto weights). However, the combinatorial factor $\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{atyp}(λ)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive.\n  In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections.\n  Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does."}

Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules."}

In this paper we introduce areal Weil heights, which generalize the areal Mahler measure to the adelic setting. We use the framework of adelic heights established by Favre and Rivera-Letelier and we construct a $p$-adic analog for the area measure on a disk in $\\mathbb{C}$. For areal Weil heights we prove an analog of Kronecker's theorem, which characterizes their small points and essential minima. Furthermore, we determine equidistribution theorems for areal Weil heights. In some cases, they have a unique limiting distribution for small points, while in others there are infinitely many limiting distributions. We conclude with examples. In one of our examples, we determine for which radii $r$ there exist sequences of conjugate sets of algebraic integers which uniformly distribute to the disk $D(0,r) \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, and we compute the limiting height for such sequences."}
