In this extent, their arithmetic over real numbers has represented an intriguing problem throughout the years. In this paper, we develop the arithmetic of continued fractions over the field of $p$-adic numbers. In particular, we provide a complete methodology to compute the $p$-adic continued fraction of the Möbius transformation and the bilinear fractional transformation of $p$-adic numbers. These allow any standard arithmetic operation over $p$-adic numbers to be performed. In great contrast with real continued fractions, we prove that the knowledge of arbitrarily many partial quotients of the initial continued fractions is not always sufficient to recover some partial quotients of the transformations. However, we prove that the set of elements for which this is not possible has Haar measure zero in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$."}

The problem reduces to finding rational sections on a genus-one fibration over $\\mathbb{Q}(S)$, which need not admit a section.

The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra."}

This result can be viewed as Roth's type theorem for linear combinations of powers of algebraic numbers over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. The case $q=1$ was recently proved by Kulkarni, Mavraki, and Nguyen \\cite{kul}, which is a generalization of Mahler's question proved in \\cite{corv}.
