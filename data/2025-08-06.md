Abstract: Let $\{N_m\}_{m\ge0}$ be the Narayana's cows sequence given by $N_0=0$,
$N_1=1=N_2=1$ and \[ N_{m+3}=N_{m+2}+N_m,\quad \text{ for }\; m\geq 0 \] and
let $\{F_n\}_{n\ge0}$ be the Fibonacci sequence. In this paper we solve
explicitely the Diophantine equation \[ N_m=F_nF_k, \] in positive unknowns
$m,\,n$ and $k$. That is, we find the non-zero narayana numbers that are
products of two Fibonacci numbers.

### [3] [An effective analytic recurrence for prime numbers: from asymptotics to explicit bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02690)
*Benoit Cloitre*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an explicit and effective recurrence formula for prime numbers,
bridging arithmetic and analytic approaches. Building upon foundational work by
Gandhi (1971), Golomb (1976), and Keller (2007), we establish the effective
bound $s_n \le 2p_n$ for all $n \ge 1$ within the Golomb-Keller analytic
recurrence. This transforms their asymptotic formula into an explicit
recurrence using twice the n-th prime as the exponent: $$ p_{n+1} = \left\lceil
\left( -1 + \zeta(2p_n) \prod_{j=1}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_j^{2p_n}}\right)
\right)^{-1/(2p_n)} \right\rceil $$ The proof is self-contained and relies on
Bertrand's postulate. We also present strong numerical and heuristic evidence
for a sharper conjecture: $s_n \le p_n$ for all $n \ge 1$, suggesting that the
formula works with the n-th prime as the exponent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在寻找计算模形式斜率序列的算法，并探讨其在Coleman-Mazur特征曲线中的对称性问题。

Method: 作者参考并利用两位作者先前在现象学猜想方面的理论成果，对最初的猜想进行了改进，最终提出了一个更精确的算法以计算斜率序列。

Result: 研究结果表明，在计算斜率序列时，我们仅需几条初始信息即可得到完整的序列，并且这些结果展示了在特征曲线中的潜在对称性。

Abstract: We give an algorithm to compute the slope sequence of modular forms with
fixed Galois components from its first few entries, which is a refined version
of the conjecture of [Buz05]. We use the results of arXiv:2302.07697 on the
ghost conjecture from axXiv:1710.01572. These symmetries in slope sequences
have potential implication to unexplained symmetries in many Coleman-Mazur
eigencurves.

### [7] [Small gaps between Goldbach primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02769)
*Mizuki Akeno*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper studies small gaps between Goldbach primes using the Bombieri-Davenport and Maynard-Tao methods, improving upon Tsuda's result for the former and showing the limitations and applicability of the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the distribution of Goldbach primes and analyze the effectiveness of different mathematical methods (Bombieri-Davenport and Maynard-Tao) in finding smaller gaps between them.

Method: The paper employs the Bombieri-Davenport method to improve the bound on the smallest gap relative to the average gap, and the Maynard-Tao method to demonstrate the existence of bounded gaps.

Result: Using Bombieri-Davenport method, the smallest gap is shown to be 0.765 times smaller than the average for almost all even integers N. The Maynard-Tao method confirms the existence of bounded gaps but does not improve the bound further.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the Bombieri-Davenport method offers a better improvement for small gaps between Goldbach primes, while the Maynard-Tao method is effective for establishing bounded gaps but does not enhance the previous result's bound.

Abstract: We study small gaps between Goldbach primes $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$
using the Bombieri-Davenport method and the Maynard-Tao method, and compare the
two.
  We show that for almost all even integers $N$, the smallest gap in
$\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ can be $0.765...$ times smaller than the
average gap using the Bombieri-Davenport method. This is an improvement on a
recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application
of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it
allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes
with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: describe the motivation in this paper

Method: method of this paper

Result: result of this paper

Conclusion: conclusion of this paper

Abstract: In this paper, we study numbers $n$ that can be factored in four different
ways as $n = A B = (A + a_1) (B - b_1) = (A + a_2) (B - b_2) = (A + a_3) (B -
b_3)$ with $B \le A$, $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < a_3 \le C$ and $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < b_3
\le C$. We obtain the optimal upper bound $A \le 0.04742 \ldots \cdot C^3 +
O(C)$. The key idea is to transform the original question into generalized Pell
equations $a x^2 - b y^2 = c$ and study their solutions.

### [9] [Redefining Euler-Rabinowitsch Polynomials with Heegner Number Based Quadratic Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02821)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of prime-generating quadratic polynomials
defined by $f_{Z,k,H}(n) = n^2 - (2Zk - 1)n + \frac{(2Zk - 1)^2 + H}{4}$, where
$Zk \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and $H$ belongs to the set of Heegner numbers.
This form is closely related to the Euler-Rabinowitsch polynomials through
specific substitutions. The structure enables algebraic tuning for prime-rich
outputs and provides deeper insight into the impact of Heegner numbers on prime
distribution. Using tools such as the Bateman-Horn conjecture and
prime-counting functions, we demonstrate that this family can be optimized to
generate a high density of primes. This work offers new directions for research
in analytic number theory and potential applications in cryptography and signal
processing.

### [11] [Explicit Hecke eigenform product identities for Hilbert modular forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03071)
*Zeping Hao,Chao Qin,Yang Zhou*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Let $F$ be a totally real number field and $g, f, h$ be Hilbert modular forms over $F$ that are Hecke eigenforms with $g = f \.cdot h$. The paper characterizes these product identities specifically for real quadratic fields of narrow class number one, finding that they only occur for $F = \\(mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$ and establishing a total of two such identities in this case. Additionally, it demonstrates that these identities do not exist when $f$ and $h$ are Eisenstein series of distinct weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the arithmetic of Hilbert modular forms and their associated Hecke eigenforms is of fundamental importance in number theory. Specifically, product identities between modular forms can arise in several natural contexts, such as in the study of relations among Eisenstein series and through theta series of orthogonal groups. The scarcity of such identities, in particular for real quadratic fields, provides a valuable opportunity to explore the underlying structures and persistence of these phenomena in the more general case.

Method: The paper approaches the problem by first characterizing the identities in the narrow class number one case, focusing on the specific real quadratic field $F = \\(mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$. This involves analyzing the properties of the Hecke eigenforms $f, h$ and their product $g$. To address the general totally real setting, the authors then demonstrate the non-existence of such product identities when both $f$ and $h$ are Eisenstein series of distinct weights, leveraging the arithmetic and analytic properties of these forms.

Result: The result shows that for all real quadratic fields of narrow class number one, product identities among Hilbert modular forms as Hecke eigenforms occur exclusively for $F=\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$, with precisely two identities found. Furthermore, the analysis extends to the general totally real case, where such identities are proven not to exist between Eisenstein series of different weights.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the phenomena of product identities between Hilbert modular forms as Hecke eigenforms is highly specific to certain totally real number fields, particularly $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$ among real quadratic fields with narrow class number one. The absence of such identities when involving Eisenstein series of different weights reinforces the understanding of their underlying arithmetic properties and the limitations in their occurrences.

Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real number field, and $g,f,h$ be Hilbert modular forms
over $F$ that are Hecke eigenforms satisfying $g=f\cdot h$. We characterize
such product identities among all real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one, proving they occur only for $F=\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$, with precisely two
such identities. We also shed some light on the general totally real case by
showing that no such identity exists when both $f$ and $h$ are Eisenstein
series of distinct weights.

### [12] [Massey products and unipotent extensions with restricted ramification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03233)
*Oussama Hamza,Donghyeok Lim,Christian Maire*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper constructs new cases of pro-p extensions of number fields with restricted ramification and splitting, leading to Galois groups with the strong Massey vanishing property and large unipotent quotients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find new examples where pro-p extensions satisfy the strong Massey vanishing property, implying the existence of large unipotent quotients. This is important for understanding the structure of Galois groups in number theory.

Method: The method involves fixing a prime p and constructing specific pro-p extensions of number fields that have restricted ramification and splitting. The Galois groups of these extensions are decomposed as coproducts of pro-p absolute Galois groups of local fields. This decomposition helps in proving the strong Massey vanishing property.

Result: The result is the construction of new cases of pro-p extensions with the desired properties and the confirmation that these extensions have the strong Massey vanishing property and large unipotent quotients.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by constructing extensions with restricted ramification and properties, the Galois groups of these extensions can be analyzed for the strong Massey vanishing property and the existence of large unipotent quotients, thereby contributing to algebraic number theory and field theory.

Abstract: We fix a prime p and construct new cases of pro-p extensions of number fields
with restricted ramification and splitting, whose Galois groups decompose as
coproducts of pro-p absolute Galois groups of local fields. As a consequence,
these pro-p extensions satisfy the strong Massey vanishing property and thus
admit large unipotent quotients.

### [13] [Iterates of post-critically finite polynomials of the form $\boldsymbol{x^d+c}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03308)
*Vefa Goksel*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper studies the arithmetic properties of post-critically finite polynomials and proves new cases of a conjecture on abelian arboreal Galois representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-critically finite (PCF) polynomials of the form $ f_{d,c} = x^d + c $ are central in polynomial dynamics, yet their arithmetic properties, particularly the factorization of their iterates over the field of definition, are not well understood. The existing literature provides a good foundation in the complex dynamical setting, but there is a clear need to explore the deeper connections between these polynomials and arithmetic structures, such as Galois representations.

Method: The paper describes the factorization of iterates of post-critically finite polynomials $ f_{d,c} $ over their fields of definition and uses this characterization to prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche regarding abelian arboreal Galois representations.

Result: The authors describe the detailed factorization of iterates for PCF polynomials and successfully prove new cases of the Andrews and Petsche conjecture on abelian arboreal Galois representations.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of the arithmetic dynamics of post-critically finite polynomials and contributes new evidence supporting the broader conjecture of abelian arboreal Galois representations, paving the way for further research in this area.

Abstract: Fix a prime number $d$. The post-critically finite polynomials of the form
$f_{d,c} = x^d+c\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ play a fundamental role in polynomial
dynamics. While many results are known in the complex dynamical setting, much
less is understood about the arithmetic properties of these polynomials. In
this paper, we describe the factorization of the iterates of post-critically
finite polynomials $f_{d,c}$ over their fields of definition. As a consequence,
we prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche on abelian arboreal
Galois representations.

### [14] [A dimensional mass transference principle from balls to open sets and applications to dynamical Diophantine approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03359)
*Yubin He*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对动力学丢番图逼近中limsup集的维数质量转移原则，该原则能够恢复和扩展关于收缩靶标的经典理论，尤其是对β变换和高斯映射进行了应用。该方法表明相关limsup集具有大的交集属性，并且可能揭示热力学形式与动力学丢番图逼近之间新的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在丢番图逼近领域，经典的Hausdorff维数及质量的确定方法通常适用于静态情形，而对于动力学丢番图逼近，由于定义limsup集的球的半径通常是点x的轨道相关映射函数，导致传统质量转移机制失效。因此，需要建立一种针对动力学特性的维数转移理论来解决诸如收缩靶标的问题。

Method: 作者旨在开发一个针对动力系统的质量转移机制，使他们能分析那些传统机制无法处理的、其半径动态依赖的情况，方法可能结合了Gibbs测度的理念, 以探究点集在该动态背景下覆盖行为与热力学形式结构的关系。

Result: 文章成功建立了一个新的维数质量转移原则，且将其有效应用于β变换与高斯映射，发现其limsup集不仅具有期望的尺寸特性，并且表现出很强的交集属性，进一步为动态系统中数据逼近行为提供了新的理论依据。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明了新的维数质量转移原则的有效性，其揭示的动力学丢番图逼近中的性质为收缩靶标分析注入了新思维，也展现了热力学形式如何赋予这种分析更丰富的角度，未来可在更广泛的动态系统上扩展该框架。

Abstract: The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful
mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets
that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of
dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply
effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets
generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.
  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that
enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target
problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map.
Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large
intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is
that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding
an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between
thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Famously, Kohel proved that isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves are
beautifully structured objects, now called volcanos. We prove graph structural
theorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism
ring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic
perspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied
on restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication,
ordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In
particular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny
classes. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the
lattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \'etale
algebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful
study of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of
volcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to
our more general setting.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore from several perspectives the following question: given
$X\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and $N\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the maximum size
$D(X,N)$ of $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ before $A$ is forced to contain two
distinct elements that differ by an element of $X$? The set of forbidden
differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the
most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and
$X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results,
including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective
cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a
comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In
particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in
graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for
$N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.
