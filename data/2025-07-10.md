Abstract: We prove that each snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type
$B_n^{(1)}$ admits a Langlands dual representation, as conjectured by Frenkel
and Hernandez (\textit{Lett. Math. Phys.} (2011) 96:217-261). Furthermore, we
establish an explicit formula, called the Langlands branching rule, which gives
the multiplicities in the decomposition of the character of a snake module of
the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ into a sum of characters of
irreducible representations of its Langlands dual algebra.

Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be two tensor rings given by weight quivers. We introduce
norms for tensor rings and $(A,B)$-bimodules, and define an important category
$\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ in this paper. We show that
$\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ has an initial object such that Daniell
integration, Bochner integration, Lebesgue integration, Stone--Weierstrass
Approximation Theorem, power series expansion, and Fourier series expansion are
morphisms in $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ start with this initial object.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We define the notions of non-abelian exotic Gauss sums and of exotic matrix
Kloosterman sums, the latter one generalizing the notions of Katz's exotic
Kloosterman sums and of twisted matrix Kloosterman sums. Using Kondo's Gauss
sum and results about Shintani lifts, we reduce non-abelian exotic Gauss sums
to products of classical (exotic) Gauss sums. Using Macdonald's characteristic
maps, we generalize our previous result and show that exotic matrix Kloosterman
sums can be expressed as products of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials
evaluated at roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the
Frobenius action on Katz's exotic Kloosterman sheaf. Using the Ginzburg-Kaplan
gamma factors that we previously defined with Carmon, we establish a relation
between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations and
exotic matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we prove various
identities.

### [4] [On the cubic Shimura lift to $PGL(3)$: Hecke correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06963)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper we establish a new Fundamental Lemma for Hecke correspondences.
Let $F$ be a local field containing the cube roots of unity. We exhibit an
algebra isomorphism of the spherical Hecke algebra of $PGL_3(F)$ and the
spherical Hecke algebra of anti-genuine functions on the cubic cover $G'$ of
$SL_3(F)$. Then we show that there is a matching (up to a specific transfer
factor) of distributions on the two groups for all functions that correspond
under this isomorphism. On $PGL_3(F)$ the distributions are relative
distributions attached to a period involving the minimal representation on
$SO_8$, while on $G'$ they are metaplectic Kuznetsov distributions. This
Fundamental Lemma is a key step towards establishing a relative trace formula
that would give a new global Shimura lift from genuine automorphic
representations on the triple cover of $SL_3$ to automorphic representations on
$PGL_3$, and also characterize the image of the lift by means of a period. It
extends the matching for the unit elements of the Hecke algebras established by
the authors in prior work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate Eisenstein discriminants, which are squarefree integers $d
\equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ such that the fundamental unit $\varepsilon_d$ of the real
quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ satisfies $\varepsilon_d \equiv 1
\pmod{2\mathcal{O}_K}$. These discriminants are related to a classical question
of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic
fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of
Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting
function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx
\frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen
while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly
different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic
fields.
  We include technical details of our computation method, which uses a modified
infrastructure approach implemented on GPUs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider approximation properties of real points by uniformly distributed
sequences. Under some assumptions on the approximation functions, we prove a
Khintchine-type $0$-$1$ dichotomy law. We establish a new connection between
uniform distribution and the ubiquity property. Namely, we show that a bound on
the discrepancy of the sequence implies the ubiquity property, which helps to
obtain divergence results. We further obtain Hausdorff dimension results for
weighted sets. The key tools in proving these results are the weighted
ubiquitous systems and weighted mass transference principle introduced recently
by Kleinbock \& Wang, and Wang \& Wu respectively.

### [7] [Simultaneous nonvanishing of Dirichlet $L$-functions in Galois orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06609)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we prove that given any two
distinct imprimitive Dirichlet characters $\eta_1, \eta_2$ modulo $q=p^k$, a
positive proportion of characters $\chi$ modulo $q$ in a fixed Galois orbit of
primitive characters satisfies the nonvanishing property that $L(1/2,\chi
\eta_1) L(1/2,\chi \eta_2) \neq 0$, as $k \to \infty$ (with $p$ fixed).
Previously, only a positive proportion of nonvanishing result was available in
Galois orbits (as opposed to simultaneously nonvanishing), due to work of Khan,
Mili\'cevi\'c and Ngo. The main ingredients are obtaining a sharp upper bound
on the mollified fourth moment over the Galois orbit using an Euler product
mollifier, and obtaining a lower bound for the mollified second moment, which
relies on using results from Diophantine approximation (such as the $p$-adic
Roth theorem). We also unconditionally compute the second moments for
$L$--functions associated to primitive Dirichlet characters in full orbits and
thinner orbits.

### [8] [The $3$-sparsity of $X^n-1$ over finite fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06655)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$
elements. For a positive integer $n$, the binomial $f_n(X):=
X^n-1\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is called $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if each
irreducible factor of $f_n(X)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is either a binomial or a
trinomial. In 2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$
for which $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$,
and posed the open problem of whether, for any given $q$, there are only
finitely many primes $p$ such that $f_p(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
In this paper, we prove that for any given odd prime power $q$, any prime $p$
for which $f_p(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ must divides $q^2-1$, thus
resolving the problem of Oliveira and Reis for odd characteristic. Furthermore,
we extend the results of Oliveira and Reis by determining all such integers $n$
for $q = 3$ and $q = 9$. More precisely, for any positive integer $n$ not
divisible by $3$, we establish that: (i) $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over
$\mathbb{F}_3$ if and only if $n = 2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$; and
(ii) $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_9$ if and only if $n =
2^{k_1}5^{k_2}$ for some nonnegative integers $k_1$ and $k_2$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the context of the Frobenius coin problem, given two relatively prime
positive integers $a$ and $b$, the set of nonrepresentable numbers consists of
positive integers that cannot be expressed as nonnegative integer combination
of $a$ and $b$. This work provides a formula for calculating the power sums of
all nonrepresentable numbers, also known as the Sylvester sums. Although
alternative formulas exist in the literature, our approach is based on an
elementary observation. We consider the set of natural numbers from $1$ to $ab
- 1$ and compute their total sum in two distinct ways, which leads naturally to
the desired Sylvester sums. This method connects an analytic identity with a
combinatorial viewpoint, giving a new way to understand these classical
quantities. Furthermore, in this paper, we establish a criterion using the
division algorithm to determine whether a given positive integer is
nonrepresentable.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We determine the precise number of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves
over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) = 3,2$. The key idea is
to obtain the exact unweighted number of rational points on the classifying
stacks $\mathcal{B} Q_{12}$, $\mathcal{B} Q_{24}$ and $\mathcal{B} Z$, where
$Q_{12}$ and $Q_{24}$ denote the dicyclic groups of orders 12 and 24,
respectively, and $Z$ denotes the non-reduced group scheme of order 2. This
computation, inspired by the classical work of [de Jong] and performed via
motivic height zeta functions of height moduli spaces constructed in
[Bejleri-Park-Satriano], establishes a complete determination of the total
number of isomorphism classes of rational points on
$\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$ over any rational function field $k(t)$ with
perfect residue field $\text{char}(k) \ge 0$.

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime field with $q \geq 3$, and let $d, m \geq 1$ be
integers such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$ and $m \mid (q - 1)$. In this
paper we bound the absolute values of the Walsh spectrum of S-Boxes $S (x) =
x^d \cdot T \left( x^\frac{q - 1}{m} \right)$, where $T$ is a function with $T
(x) \neq 0$ if $x \neq 0$. Such S-Boxes have been proposed for the
Zero-Knowledge-friendly hash functions Grendel and Polocolo. In particular, we
prove the conjectured correlation of the Polocolo S-Box.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In an earlier paper, we proved that Montgomery's Pair Correlation Conjecture
(PCC) for zeros of the Riemann zeta-function can be used to prove without the
assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) that asymptotically 100% of the zeros
are both simple and on the critical line. This is based on a method of
Gallagher and Mueller from 1978. We formulate an appropriate form of the
Alternative Hypothesis (AH), which determines a different PCC, and, using the
same method as above, prove that asymptotically, 100% of the zeros are both
simple and on the critical line. As in our previous paper, we do not assume RH.

Abstract: Let $f(x) = x^{2g+1} + c_1 x^{2g} + \dots + c_{2g+1} \in k[x]$ be a
polynomial of nonzero discriminant, and let $J$ denote the Jacobian of the odd
hyperelliptic curve $C : y^2 = f(x)$. We show that the morphism $J \to
\mathbb{P}^{2^g-1}$ associated to the linear system $|2 \Theta|$ may be
described explicitly, for any $g \geq 1$, using the theory of pure spinors.
  We apply this theory to study the heights of rational points in $J(k)$, when
$k$ is a number field. As a particular consequence, we show that $100\%$ of
monic, degree $2g+1$ polynomials $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of nonzero
discriminant $\Delta(f)$ have the property that, for any non-trivial point $P
\in J(\mathbb{Q})$, the canonical height of $P$ satisfies $
\widehat{h}_\Theta(P) \geq \left(\frac{3g-1}{4g(2g+1)} - \epsilon\right) \log |
\Delta(f) |$. This is a `density 1' form of the Lang--Silverman conjecture.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study an effective open image theorem for families of elliptic curves and
products of elliptic curves ordered by conductor. Unconditionally, we prove
that for $100\%$ of pairs of elliptic curves, the largest prime $\ell$, for
which the associated mod $\ell$ Galois representation fails to be surjective,
is small. Additionally, for semistable families, our bound on $\ell$ is
comparable to the result obtained under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. We
reduce the problem to a Linnik type problem for modular forms and apply the
zero density estimates. This method, together with an analysis of the local
Galois representations of elliptic curves, allows us to show similar results
for single elliptic curves.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integer factorization is a fundamental problem in algorithmic number theory
and computer science. It is considered as a one way or trapdoor function in the
(RSA) cryptosystem. To date, from elementary trial division to sophisticated
methods like the General Number Field Sieve, no known algorithm can break the
problem in polynomial time, while its proved that Shor's algorithm could on a
quantum computer. In this paper, we recall some factorization algorithms and
then approach the problem under different angles. Firstly, we take the problem
from the ring $\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right)$ to the
Lebesgue space $\mathcal{L}^{1}\left(X\right)$ where $X$ can be $\mathbb{Q}$ or
any given interval setting. From this first perspective, integer factorization
becomes equivalent to finding the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is known.
In this case, it is equivalent to either finding bounds of integrals or finding
primitives for some given bounds. Secondly, we take the problem from the ring
$\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right) $ to the ring of
matrices $\left( M_{2}\text{(}\mathbb{Z}\text{)}, \ \text{+} \ \cdot\right)$
and show that this problem is equivalent to matrix decomposition, and therefore
present some possible computing algorithms, particularly using Gr\"obner basis
and through matrix diagonalization. Finally, we address the problem depending
on algebraic forms of factors and show that this problem is equivalent to
finding small roots of a bivariate polynomial through coppersmith's method.
  The aim of this study is to propose innovative methodological approaches to
reformulate this problem, thereby offering new perspectives.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of three close factorizations of an

the hyperbola $x y = N$. We establish optimal lower bounds for $L^1$-distance
between these lattice points and the center. We also give some good examples
based on polynomials and Pell equations more systematically.
