One can\nextend $\\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a\nnumber field. For $|\\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\\psi$-twisted $L$-function has\ninteresting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute\nconvergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic\ncontinuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet\n$L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we\nshow that $\\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic\nDirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.", "AI": {"tldr": "generate a too long; didn't read summary", "motivation": "describe the motivation in this paper", "method": "method of this paper", "result": "result of this paper", "conclusion": "conclusion of this paper"}}
