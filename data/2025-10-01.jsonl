For all $1270$ genus $1$ quotients $X$ with $N$\nsquarefree, we determine the isomorphism class of the Jacobian $X$. For $146$\nnon-elliptic genus $1$ curves $X$ and for $405$ curves genus $2$ quotients $X$,\nwe provide a defining equation for $X$. A main tool for us is the theory of\n\\v{C}erednik--Drinfeld uniformizations of the curves $X_0^D(N)$, which we\nimplement in wider generality than has previously been done in the literature."}

We\nshow that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of\nvector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the\ncommutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent\nradicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are\ntype I groups.
