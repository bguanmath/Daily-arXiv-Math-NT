In particular, we explicitly construct an exact sequence of the standard modules of $\\mathrm{TL}_n(0)$, which categorifies a numerical coincidence regarding the evaluation of the Jones polynomial at $t=-1$. We furthermore deduce a consequence in the representation theory of symmetric groups over characteristic two."}

Any comments welcome", "summary": "For a simple, simply-connected, simply-laced algebraic group $G$, we construct a monoidal categorification of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties. This class of varieties includes, in particular, braid varieties and restricted double Bruhat cells. In addition, we define a natural subalgebra of the bosonic extension algebra $\\widehat{\\mathcal{A}}$ and show that this subalgebra provides a quantization of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties."}

We identify the resulting diagram category with a linear quotient of a nonorientable two-dimensional cobordism category. Finally, we develop the associated cell theory and use it to classify the simple modules and compute dimensions in a range of cases."}

The key innovation is the factorization $h_T = g_T \\star \\widetilde{g}_T$, which simultaneously achieves: (i) automatic positive semi-definiteness of the spectral multiplier $m_{h_T}(π) = |m_{g_T}(π)|^2 \\ge 0$; (ii) $J$-fold moment annihilation via a multi-scale Vandermonde construction, yielding super-polynomial decay of all error terms; (iii) uniform spectral parameter bounds (Master-Bound) $\\mathfrak{E}_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T) \\ll T^{d+1-δ}$ with $δ> 0$ depending only on the symmetry order $k$ and the annihilation depth $J \\asymp \\sqrt{(\\log T)/k}$, representing a power saving over the main term $\\asymp T^{d+1}$. The cost is a controlled polynomial growth $T^{c_0^2/2+o(1)}$ in the Vandermonde coefficients (with exponent strictly less than 1), which is dominated by the super-polynomial decay of the off-diagonal terms. The construction is axiomatized over two analytic hypotheses -- a Weyl law and Bessel/Airy asymptotics -- making it applicable beyond the classical $\\mathrm{GL}(2)$ setting."}

Under quantitative mixing and exponential cylinder estimates for constant words, a general theorem is proved. Quantitative almost-sure logarithmic growth is obtained, and eventual two-sided bounds with double-logarithmic error terms are established. For continued-fraction partial quotients, explicit centring constants and double-logarithmic error bounds are derived for both statistics."}
