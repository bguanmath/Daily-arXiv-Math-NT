In 1964,\nAndrews--improving on a result of Dragonette--gave an asymptotic formula for\nthe coefficients of $f(q)$ and conjectured an exact formula for the\ncoefficients: a conditionally convergent series that closely resembles the\nHardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula for the partition function. To prove that\nthe conjectured series converges, it is necessary to carefully measure the\ncancellation among the Kloosterman sums appearing in the formula. Andrews'\nconjecture was proved four decades later by Bringmann and Ono. Here we prove\nexact formulas for all seventeen of the mock theta functions appearing in\nRamanujan's last letter. Along the way, we prove a general theorem bounding\nsums of Kloosterman sums for the Weil representation attached to a lattice of\nodd rank."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This article presents a comprehensive data-scientific investigation into the\narithmetic statistics of congruent number elliptic curves, leveraging a dataset\nof square-free integers up to $3$ million. We analyze the Mordell-Weil ranks,\n2-Selmer ranks, and 3-Selmer ranks of the corresponding elliptic curves $E_D:\ny^2 = x^3 - D^2x$, where $D$ is a square-free number. Our study empirically\nexamines the Heath-Brown heuristics, which predict the distribution of\n$2$-Selmer ranks as well as congruent numbers based on their residue modulo\n$8$. In particular, offering statistical insights into the proportion of\nnumbers whose associated elliptic curves have positive rank. We provide a\nrigorous verification of Goldfeld's Conjecture in this context, analyzing the\ndistribution of analytic ranks and demonstrating their alignment with the\nconjectured $50/50$ split for ranks $0$ and $1$. Furthermore, we explore the\nconjectural asymptotic distribution of $2-$ and $3$-torsion part of the\nTate-Shafarevich group of these curves. Based on empirical evidence, we also\nsuggest potential statistical distribution of $3$-Selmer and Mordell-Weil\nranks. We also examine the averages of Frobenius traces and observe that they\ntend to zero without exhibiting any murmuration-like patterns.\n  In addition to these number-theoretic analyses, we apply machine learning\ntechniques to classify and predict congruent numbers, exploring the efficacy of\ncomputational methods in distinguishing congruent from non-congruent numbers\nbased on the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves. This interdisciplinary\napproach blends advanced number theory with modern data science, providing\nempirical support for conjectures as well as discovery of new patterns."}
