A major limitation of the\ntraditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order\nstructural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering\napplications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation\ntheory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only\nlower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the\nreformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor\nfunctions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point\ngroup, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the\nrepresentations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and\nsecond-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable\nto all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are\ndetermined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups. The representation\ntheory presented here is broadly applicable for constitutive modeling of\nanisotropic materials."}
