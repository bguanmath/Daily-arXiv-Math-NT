### [1] [Finite Langlands correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15101)
*Naoki Imai*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct the Langlands correspondence for connected reductive groups over
finite fields, which we call the finite Langlands correspondence. We discuss
also its relation with the categorical local Langlands correspondence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove a sharp density theorem for quadratic Waring's problem over cyclic
groups, when the number of variables is at least $5$. Also, we obtain some new
improvements on the density version of the quadratic Waring--Goldbach problem
over integers.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study five pencils of projective quartic Delsarte K3 surfaces. Over finite
fields, we give explicit formulas for the point counts of each family, written
in terms of hypergeometric sums. Over the complex numbers, we match the periods
of the corresponding family with hypergeometric differential operators and
series. We also obtain a decomposition of the $L$-function of each pencil in
terms of hypergeometric $L$-series and Dedekind zeta functions. This gives an
explicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by
each pencil.

### [4] [Integer continued fractions for complex numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15078)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a natural extension to complex numbers of the standard continued
fractions. The basic algorithm is due to Lagrange and Gauss, though it seems to
have gone mostly unnoticed as a way to create continued fractions. The new
representations are shown to be unique, and to have useful properties. They
also admit a geometric cutting sequence interpretation.

### [5] [Determining class groups as Galois modules up to equivalence for some nonabelian extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15242)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In previous papers, the Galois module structure of minus class groups was
studied for abelian CM extensions. In this paper, we discuss some nonabelian
cases, focusing on metacyclic extensions. For a certain class of these, we
obtain a complete description of the Galois modules that occur as minus class
groups, modulo a certain equivalence relation on modules, which was introduced
earlier by the same authors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Definitions of dense linear orders (with/without endpoints), separable linear
orders, complete linear orders, the countable chain condition for linear
orders, a Suslin line/Suslin tree and Suslin's problem Statement and proof of
Cantor's Theorem characterizing (Q,<) as the only countable dense linear order
without endpoints, up to isomorphism, the corollary which characterizes (R,<)
as the only separable complete dense linear order without endpoints, every
countable linear order embeds into (Q,<) (and thus, into (R,<)). Explanation of
why Suslin lines and Suslin trees are equivalent, what an Aronszjan line/tree
is, how it's a weakening of a Suslin line/tree. History and independence of
Suslin's problem.

### [7] [Non-negligible summands in tensor powers of some modular representations of finite $p$-groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15730)
*Kent B. Vashaw,Justin Zhang*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了素数为奇数时，与特定构造的有限群方案相关的模表示的张量积的结构，其中特别关注模3时的情况，发现了一类无限表示族，其张量积包含对称群 S_3 的表示模3的张量子范畴，并与 Etingof 提出的广义 Benson 猜想想呼应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dave Benson 的猜想在 p=2 时成立，但对一般奇素数的情况并不成立，因此需要研究更一般的条件。Etingof 的猜想试图推广这一结果，论文在此背景下探索满足某些张量积条件的模表示。

Method: 作者研究了一类具有与p互质维数的梯度表示 V，并分析了其张量积 $V 	ensor V^*$ 的结构。特别地，在p=3时通过构造无限表示族论与平衡素数结构，展示了张量积包含 $S_3$ 的模表示，并运用张量积子范畴的生成理论进行分析。

Result: 在 p=3 时，存在无限的模3表示族 V，使得 $V 	ensor V^*$ 的张量积中除 $e$ 外的子模均为偶数维。且这些 V 生成的子范畴中包含 $S_3$ 的模3表示。

Conclusion: 论文表明在一般奇素数 (特别是3) 时，存在满足张量积条件的模表示，与 Etingof 顾的猜想相一致，这些结果推进了 Benson 猜想在奇素数设的更探讨。

Abstract: Let $p>0$ be a prime, $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $\Bbbk$ be an
algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. Dave Benson has conjectured
that if $p=2$ and $V$ is an odd-dimensional indecomposable representation of
$G$ then all summands of the tensor product $V \otimes V^*$ except for $\Bbbk$
have even dimension. It is known that the analogous result for general $p$ is
false. In this paper, we investigate the class of graded representations $V$
which have dimension coprime to $p$ and for which $V \otimes V^*$ has a
non-trivial summand of dimension coprime to $p$, for a graded group scheme
closely related to $\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p^s
\mathbb{Z}$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $p>2$. We produce
an infinite family of such representations in characteristic 3 and show in
particular that the tensor subcategory generated by any of these
representations in the semisimplification contains the modulo $3$ reduction of
the category of representations of the symmetric group $S_3$. Our results are
compatible with a general version of Benson's conjecture due to Etingof.
