To this end we generalize the Tate module construction\nto a tensor functor on $F_{\\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily\npure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that\nconstruction behaves under reduction of $M$. As an offshoot we obtain a new\nkind of $\\wp$-adic Weil representations associated to Drinfeld modules of\nspecial characteristic $\\wp$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51faAnderson A-\u52d5\u6a5fM\u5728\u5e7e\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684A\u7d20\u6578\u8655\u7522\u751f Tate \u6a21\u7684Galois\u8868\u793a\u517c\u5bb9\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5e76\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u8207F-isocrystals\u548cDrinfeld\u6a21\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u7279\u5fb5wp\u76f8\u95dc\u7684Weil\u7fa4\u8868\u793a", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u904e\u5ee3\u7fa9Tate\u6a21\u7684\u69cb\u9020\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684Weil\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u51fd\u6578\u57dfF\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76Anderson A-\u52d5\u6a5f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8ad6", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c07Tate\u6a21\u7684\u69cb\u9020\u63a8\u5ee3\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f35\u91cf\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u61c9\u7528\u65bc$F_\\mathfrak{p}$-isocrystals\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u7d14\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u904e\u8b49\u660e\u8a72\u51fd\u5b50\u5728M\u7684\u7d04\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u4f86\u9054\u6210\u76ee\u6a19", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5c07Galois\u8868\u793a\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u7cfb\u7d71\u64f4\u5c55\u70ba\u8207\u6bcf\u500bF\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u95dc\u7684Weil\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e26\u76f8\u5bb9\u5168\u5c40\u51fd\u6578\u5834F\u7684\u60c5\u5883", "conclusion": "\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u5168\u65b0\u7684$\\wp$-adic Weil\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u8207\u7279\u6b8a\u7279\u5fb5$\\wp$\u7684Drinfeld\u6a21\u76f8\u95dc\uff0c\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u7d14$F_{\\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e26\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u975e\u7d14\u7684\u6848\u4f8b"}}
