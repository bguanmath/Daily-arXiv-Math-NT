Abstract: Given a semisimple Lie group $G$ and a self-opposite flag manifold
$\mathcal{F}$ of $G$, we establish a necessary condition for an infinite
subgroup $H$ of $G$ to preserve a proper domain in $\mathcal{F}$. In the case
where $G$ is a Hermitian Lie group of tube type, we introduce and study a
notion of causal convexity in the Shilov boundary $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ of the
symmetric space of $G$, inspired by the one already existing in conformal
Lorentzian geometry. We show that subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are transverse with
respect to a parabolic subgroup of $G$ defining $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ and that
preserve a proper domain in $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ satisfy a geometric property with
respect to this causal convexity, close to the strong projective convex
cocompactness defined by Danciger--Gu\'eritaud--Kassel. This result highlights
the spatial nature of the dynamics of $H$. We construct Zariski-dense examples
of such transverse subgroups.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper defines an asymptotic character map which is a morphism from the
Grothendieck group of category $\mathcal{O}$ of an integral filtered
quantization to rational functions on the Lie algebra of a torus. We show that
the asymptotic character of a module computes the equivariant multiplicity of
its characteristic cycle. We then apply this construction to truncated shifted
Yangians coming from simple, simply-laced Lie algebras and draw connections
with characters of modules over KLR algebras using an equivalence of categories
of arXiv:1806.07519. Our main theorem shows how this new formalism gives
formulas relating equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen cycles and
characters of modules over cyclotomic KLR algebras. We explain how this result
provides evidence that the change-of-basis between Lusztig's dual canonical
basis and the Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen basis of $\mathbb{C}[N]$ is computed by a
characteristic cycle map whose domain is category $\mathcal{O}$ for truncated
shifted Yangians, implying that the coefficients are non-negative integers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let G be the group of rational points of a connected reductive group over a
finite field. Based on work of Lusztig and Yun, we make the Jordan
decomposition for irreducible G-representations canonical. It comes in the form
of an equivalence between the category of G-representations with a fixed
semisimple parameter s and the category of unipotent representations of an
endoscopic group of G, enriched with an equivariant structure with respect to
the component group of the centralizer of s.
  Next we generalize these results, replacing the connected reductive group by
a smooth group scheme with reductive neutral component. Again we establish
canonical equivalences for both the rational and the geometric series of
G-representations, in terms of unipotent representations of endoscopic groups.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has
nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an
anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest
column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a
non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from
$(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process.
In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization
is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the
GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the
truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the
GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.

Abstract: Let $D$ be the quatenion division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field
$F$ of characteristic zero and odd residual characterisitc. We show that an
irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is
$\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here,
$\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the
recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations
by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of
$\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted
by D.Prasad.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A quasi-hereditary algebra is an algebra equipped with a certain partial
order $\unlhd$ on its simple modules. Such a partial order -- called a
quasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module
$T_{\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to
determine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting
modules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module,
which is a pair $(T,\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order
$\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along
$\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a
tilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\unlhd$ so
that $(T,\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\unlhd}$. This
result enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory.
  As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all
tilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear
Nakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of
the set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula
for enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the
quasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree
sequences.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a possibly twisted loop group $LG$, and any character sheaf of its
Iwahori subgroup, we identify the associated affine Hecke category with a
combinatorial category of Soergel bimodules. In fact, we prove such results for
affine Hecke categories arising from central extensions of the loop group $LG$.
Our results work for mod $\ell$ or integral $\ell$-adic coefficients.
  As applications, we obtain endoscopic equivalences between affine Hecke
categories, including the derived Satake equivalence for metaplectic groups,
and a series of conjectures by Gaitsgory in quantum geometric Langlands.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We implement an algorithm to compute the number of points over finite fields
for the Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ and their Atkin--Lehner quotients. Our
computations result in many examples of curves which attain the largest known
point counts among curves of specified genus over a finite field of given
cardinality. To illustrate the utility of our point counts algorithm in
addressing arithmetic questions, we prove that all automorphisms are
Atkin--Lehner for many curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $DN\leq 10000$, and we determine
all tetragonal curves $X_0^D(N)$ up to a small number of possible exceptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Erdős在1950年首次提出覆盖系统概念后，该领域研究主要集中在满足特定模条件的系统识别。奇数覆盖问题作为核心开放问题之一，具有重要的理论意义。

Method: 作者对该问题进行了理论分析，允许一个奇数重复出现作为模数，而其他模数则为互不相同的奇数且大于1。

Result: 通过研究该变种问题，作者提出了允许一个奇数重复使用的覆盖系统的存在条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为奇数覆盖问题的变体提供了理论依据，可能促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s first introduced the idea of covering systems in 1950. Since then,
much of the work in this area has concentrated on identifying covering systems
that meet specific conditions on their moduli. Among the central open problems
in this field is the well-known odd covering problem. In this paper, we
investigate a variant of that problem, where one odd integer is permitted to
appear multiple times as a modulus in the covering system, while all remaining
moduli are distinct odd integers greater than 1.

### [10] [The structure of the double discriminant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16138)
*Theresa C. Anderson,Adam Bertelli,Evan M. O'Dorney*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper studies the double discriminant of a polynomial, which is relevant to the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem, conjectures its factorization into a product of a square, a cube, and possibly a linear monomial, and proves it when the coefficient of x is zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of double discriminants may help in proving or understanding the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem, which is an important result in mathematics.

Method: The study involves analyzing the double discriminant of polynomials, making conjectures about its factorization, and proving specific cases.

Result: The conjecture that the double discriminant is the product of a square, a cube, and possibly a linear monomial is proven when k=0.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of the structure of double discriminants, which might lead to further developments in the study of the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem.

Abstract: For a polynomial $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$, we study the double
discriminant $DD_{n,k} = \operatorname{disc}_{a_k} \operatorname{disc}_x f(x)$,
which appears in the proof of the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem. We
conjecture that $DD_{n,k}$ is the product of a square, a cube, and possibly a
linear monomial and we prove this when $k=0$. We also investigate the
(typically large and smooth) outlying integer constant in the factorization of
$DD_{n,k}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let eta(z) be the Dedekind eta function. Newman studied the modularity of
eta-quotients, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of the
form \prod_{0 < m | N} eta(mz)^{r_m} to be a (weakly) holomorphic modular form
of level N. We explain a proof of Newman's theorem, developed while teaching a
class for talented high school students at Canada/USA Mathcamp. The key
observation is that although Gamma_1(N) is not generated by its upper
triangular and lower triangular subgroups, it is generated by those subgroups
together with any congruence subgroup. Modularity with respect to some
congruence subgroup is established using one simple identity involving the
multiplier system of eta(z), whose proof is elementary in the sense that it
avoids the use of Dedekind sums.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd)
biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of
${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's
theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be
expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic forms. This improved
Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$
biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show
that an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic form with a nontrivial zero {can} be
expressed as an $(m-1) \times (n-1) \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic
form. Furthermore, we show that an $m \times 2$ positive definite (pd)
biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of a square of a quadratic form,
and an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Thus, the
sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic forms is reduced to the sos
rank problem of an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic
forms. We then show that an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite
quartic form has at least two nontrivial zeros, and the discriminent of a $2
\times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form can be expressed as the
sum of the square of three cubic forms.

### [13] [Simultaneous multiplicative rational approximation to a real and a $p$-adic numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16503)
*Yann Bugeaud,Bernard de Mathan*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The present study provides new examples of a conjecture on simultaneous multiplicative approximation by rational numbers in 2007 proposed by Einsiedler and Kleinbock.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to investigate and expand upon a conjecture put forward by Einsiedler and Kleinbock in 2007 concerning simultaneous multiplicative approximation involving real and p-adic numbers, which is relevant in the field of number theory due to the importance of understanding the distribution and approximation of numbers across different number systems.

Method: The authors of the paper discover and construct new examples of pairs involving real and p-adic numbers to verify the conjecture, possibly employing advanced techniques in Diophantine approximation and properties of rational numbers in both real and non-Archimedean settings.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates new instances of number pairs that meet the conditions of the Einsiedler and Kleinbock conjecture, thus contributing to the body of evidence supporting its validity.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely reinforces the significance of these new examples in the broader context of the conjecture, potentially suggesting further avenues for research or applications in number theory related to multiplicative approximation.

Abstract: We give new examples of pairs composed of a real and a $p$-adic numbers that
satisfy a conjecture on simultaneous multiplicative approximation by rational
numbers formulated by Einsiedler and Kleinbock in 2007.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n
\geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of
the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the
Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is
number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over
coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued
fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known
upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative
error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.

*Zeyu Huang,Timothy Huber,James McLaughlin,Pengjun Wang,Yan Xu,Dongxi Ye*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Fourier coefficient signs of specific eta quotients using theta function dissections and quintuple product formulas, addressing multiple conjectures by Bringmann et al.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the signs of Fourier coefficients in eta quotients to address and extend conjectures proposed by Bringmann et al., particularly for the case of the quotient $(q^2;q^2)_{\infty}(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^{-1}$.

Method: The analysis involves dissecting expansions for theta functions and applying a general dissection formula for certain classes of quintuple products. The authors provide a characterization of coefficient sign patterns for the given eta quotient expression.

Result: The results include a characterization of coefficient sign patterns for the eta quotient $ \frac{(q^i;q^i)_{\infty}}{(q^p;q^p)_{\infty}} $ where $ i > 1 $ and $ p > 3 $, along with sign distributions for additional classes of eta quotients. This addresses and extends the conjectures mentioned.

Conclusion: The paper successfully provides a sign analysis for various eta quotients, offering insights into the coefficient structures and resolving multiple conjectures proposed by Bringmann et al.

Abstract: The signs of Fourier coefficients of certain eta quotients are determined by
dissecting expansions for theta functions and by applying a general dissection
formula for certain classes of quintuple products. A characterization is given
for the coefficient sign patterns for \[
\frac{(q^i;q^i)_{\infty}}{(q^p;q^p)_{\infty}} \] for integers \( i > 1 \) and
primes \( p > 3 \). The sign analysis for this quotient addresses and extends a
conjecture of Bringmann et al. for the coefficients of \(
(q^2;q^2)_{\infty}(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^{-1} \). The sign distribution for
additional classes of eta quotients is considered. This addresses multiple
conjectures posed by Bringmann et al.

Result: 研究报告了推广Dedekind-Rademacher cocycle到$ℓL_2(ℌ)$的同余子群的结果，并且展示了这些推广后的cocycles可以参数化一个L值家族。重要的是，作者证明了这些L值的整性。

Conclusion: 文章的结论是，推广了的Dedekind-Rademacher cocycle不仅保持原来的基本特点，还能有效参数化L值家族，这为数论领域的进一步研究打下了基础。

Abstract: We construct a generalization of the Dedekind-Rademacher cocycle to
congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$, and derive some of its
basic properties. In particular, we show that it parametrizes a family of
$L$-values and prove the integrality of these values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to further understand the properties and identities of overpartitions by applying and extending the framework of parity-separated partitions, as introduced by Andrews.

Method: The method involves using techniques from q-series and modular forms to derive and prove identities related to the generating functions of 16 overpartition families with parts separated by parity.

Result: The key results include generating functions for 16 overpartition families and proofs of several q-series identities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the generalized approach to overpartitions separated by parity provides significant insights into their connections with modular forms, q-hypergeometric series, and mock modular forms.

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Andrews' partitions separated by parity to
overpartitions in two ways. We investigate the generating functions for 16
overpartition families whose parts are separated by parity, and we prove
various $q$-series identities for these functions. These identities include
relations to modular forms, $q$-hypergeometric series, and mock modular forms.
