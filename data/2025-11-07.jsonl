The present paper studies the structure\nof mod $p$ principal series representations of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathcal{O} /\n\\mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic\nfield $F$ and $\\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal.

If $F / \\mathbb{Q}_p$\nis totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is\ndetermined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$\nis ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are\ndetermined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the\nprincipal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely\nrelated to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the\nstructure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this\nprovides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by\nBreuil and Pa\\u{s}k\\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise\nto supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$."}
