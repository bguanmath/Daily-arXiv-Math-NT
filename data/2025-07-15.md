Abstract: We introduce the concept of the modularity of an abelian variety defined over
the rational number field extending the modularity of an elliptic curve. We
discuss the modularity of an abelian variety over the rational number field. We
conjecture that a simple abelian variety over the rational number field is
modular.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $k\ge 1$ be an integer. A positive integer $n$ is $k$-\textit{gleeful} if
$n$ can be represented as the sum of $k$th powers of consecutive primes. For
example, $35=2^3+3^3$ is a $3$-gleeful number, and $195=5^2+7^2+11^2$ is
$2$-gleeful. In this paper, we present some new results on $k$-gleeful numbers
for $k>1$.
  First, we extend previous analytical work. For given values of $x$ and $k$,
we give explicit upper and lower bounds on the number of $k$-gleeful
representations of integers $n\le x$.
  Second, we describe and analyze two new, efficient parallel algorithms, one
theoretical and one practical, to generate all $k$-gleeful representations up
to a bound $x$.
  Third, we study integers that are multiply gleeful, that is, integers with
more than one representation as a sum of powers of consecutive primes,
including both the same or different values of $k$. We give a simple heuristic
model for estimating the density of multiply-gleeful numbers, we present
empirical data in support of our heuristics, and offer some new conjectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This is a continuation of the adelic version of Kwan's formula. At
non-archimedean places we give a bound of the weight function on the mixed
moment side, when the weight function on the $\mathrm{PGL}_3 \times
\mathrm{PGL}_2$ side is nearly the characteristic function of a short family.
Our method works for any tempered representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{PGL}_3$, and
reveals the structural reason for the appearance of Katz's hypergeometric sums
in a previous joint work with P.Xi.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, and $P \in
E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ be an $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational point. We study the sums \[
S_{\chi,P}(N,h) = \sum_{n=1}^N \chi(\psi_n(P)) \chi(\psi_{n+h}(P)), \] where
$\psi_n(P)$ denotes the $n$-th division polynomial evaluated at $P$, and $\chi$
is a multiplicative character of $\mathbb{F}_p^{*}$. We estimate
$S_{\chi,P}(N,h)$ on average over $h$ over a rather short interval $h \in [1,
H]$. We also obtain a multidimensional generalisation of this result.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider some $q$-series which depend on a pair of positive integers
$(k,m)$. While positivity of these series holds for the first few values of
$(k,m)$, the situation is quite unclear for other values of $(k,m)$. In
addition, our series generate the number of certain two-color integer
partitions weighted by $(-1)^j$ where $j$ is the number of even parts.
Therefore, inequalities involving these partitions will be deduced from the
positivity of their generating functions.

### [6] [The asymptotic Mahler measure of Gaussian periods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09303)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of
particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their
Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate
is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of
increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler
measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated
algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest
that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler
measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given
odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double
logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The
proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive
polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions,
class field theory, and Linnik's constant.

### [7] [Beyond endoscopy for $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with ramification 2: bounds towards the Ramanujan conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09655)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We continue generalizing Altu\u{g}'s work on $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over
$\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting for \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to the
ramified case where ramification occurs at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with
$2\in S$, after generalizing the first step. We establish a new proof of the
$1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part
in the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altu\u{g}'s original
approach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the
contributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply
the main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional
representations within the elliptic part. Finally, we employ technical analytic
estimates to bound the remainder terms in the elliptic part.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $(m, n, k)$ be a tuple of integers with the property that if $i \leq k$,
then $m + i$ and $n + i$ have the same radical. Using a result on the abc
Conjecture, we bound $k$ from above, improving a result of Balasubramanian,
Shorey, and Waldschmidt. We also bound the number of pairs $(m, n)$ for which
$m < n \leq x$ and $m(m + 1) \cdots (m + k - 1))$ and $n(n + 1) \cdots (n +
\ell - 1)$ have the same radical and the number of pairs for which $m + i$ and
$n + i$ have the same radical for all $i < k$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points
on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height
pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear
both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it.
This paper explores the relavence of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this
problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve
and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm
to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the
Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of
the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores relations between two separate worlds. They are the
algebraic geometry of Alexander Grothendieck and the automorphic representation
theory of Robert Langlands. The relation between them would be a very broad
example of the fundamental duality between geometric objects and spectral
objects that permeates much of modern mathematics. Our goal is to introduce
explicit conjectural constructions of the universal groups that govern much of
these theories, and to explore the relations between them.

Abstract: In 2019, Xiang Fan \cite{xfan} classified all permutation polynomials of

polynomials over finite fields of order $q\in\{11,~13,~17,~19,~25,~49\}.$ In
addition, the non-existence of these polynomials is established for certain
fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic
torsion of congruence quotients of
$\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SO}(n)$ in terms of the volume.
The result is based on a new bound on the trace of the heat kernel in this
setting, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital
integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires
the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define
and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda$. The motivation is possible
applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, although the
connection in this setting is as of yet conjectural.

Abstract: For a number field $K$ let $\mathcal{S}_K$ be the maximal subgroup of the
multiplicative group $K^\times$ that embeds into the unit circle under each
embedding of $K$ into the complex numbers. The group $\mathcal{S}_K$ can be
seen as an archimedean counterpart to the group of units $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$
of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is a
CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K/{\mathop{\rm Tor}\nolimits}(K^\times)$ is a free
abelian group of infinite rank. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is not a
CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K=\{\pm 1\}$. In the former case $\mathcal{S}_K$ is
the kernel of the relative norm map from $K^\times$ to the multiplicative
subgroup $k^\times$ of the maximal totally real subfield $k$ of $K$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $r,\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex
valued, $|f|\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses.
Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities
$r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses
over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent
effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the
mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also
provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions
and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of an abelian group, their sumset is
$A+B:=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}$. We study sumsets in discrete abelian groups,
where at least one summand has positive upper Banach density.
  Renling Jin proved that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers having positive
upper Banach density, then $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Bergelson, Furstenberg,
and Weiss improved the conclusion to "$A+B$ is piecewise Bohr." Beiglb\"ock,
Bergelson, and Fish showed this to be qualitatively optimal, in the sense that
if $C\subseteq \mathbb Z$ is piecewise Bohr, then there are $A, B\subseteq
\mathbb Z$ having positive upper Banach density such that $A+B\subseteq C$.
  We improve these results by establishing a strong correspondence between
sumsets in discrete abelian groups, level sets of convolutions in compact
abelian groups, and sumsets in compact abelian groups. Our proofs avoid measure
preserving dynamics and nonstandard analysis, and our results apply to discrete
abelian groups of any cardinality.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce compatible cleft extensions of abelian categories,

extension, then both the functor $l$ and the left adjoint of $i$ preserve
Gorenstein projective objects. Moreover, we give some necessary conditions for
an object of $\mathcal{A}$ to be Gorenstein projective, and we show that these
necessary conditions are also sufficient in some special case. As applications,
we unify some known results on the description of Gorenstein projective modules
over triangular matrix rings, Morita context rings with zero homomorphisms and
$\theta$-extensions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two cyclotomic level maps defined
respectively on the set of nilpotent orbits $\underline{\mathcal{N}}$ in a
complex semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and the set of conjugacy classes
$\underline{W}$ in its Weyl group, with values in positive integers. We show
that these maps are compatible under Lusztig's map $\underline{W} \to
\underline{\mathcal{N}}$, which is also the minimal reduction type map as shown
by Yun. We also discuss their relationship with two-sided cells in affine Weyl
groups.
  We use these maps to formulate a conjecture on the associated varieties of
simple affine vertex algebras attached to $\mathfrak{g}$ at non-admissible
integer levels, and provide some evidence for this conjecture.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group
  defined over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic
  $p$. Let $\ell$ be a prime number with $\ell\neq p$. Let $\Gamma$
  be a group of automorphisms of $G$ of order $\ell$. Let $\Pi$ be an
  $\ell$-modular irreducible smooth representation of $G(F)$ which
  extends as a representation of $G(F)\rtimes \Gamma$. We show that
  the Jacquet modules of the Tate cohomology groups
  $\widehat{H}^i(\Gamma, \Pi)$ are sub modules of certain Jacquet
  modules of $\Pi$. When $\Gamma$ is induced by a Galois automorphism,
  we use this result on Jacquet modules to show that
  $\widehat{H}^i(\Gamma, \Pi)$ is a finite length representation. We
  further use the Jacquet-modules to study some irreducibility of Tate
  cohomology in the cyclic base change lifting of cuspidal
  representations. The novelty in this article is that we do not
  assume that the base change lifting is cuspidal. Later in this
  article, we study these results for the finite fields case where we
  obtain a much precise description of the Tate cohomology
  groups. Finally, we end this article by studying the Tate cohomology
  of the mod-$\ell$ reduction of the unipotent cuspidal representation
  of ${\rm Sp}_4(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell})$ for the action of
  ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell}/\mathbb{F}_q)$.

Abstract: We construct a global Hecke-Baxter operator for integrable systems of

$GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash GL_2(\mathbb{R})/O_2$. Eigenvalues of the global
Hecke-Baxter operator acting on the $GL_2$-Eisenstein series are given by the
corresponding global $L$-factors. This construction generalizes our previous
construction of the Hecke-Baxter operators over local completions $\mathbb{R}$
and $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of the number field $\mathbb{Q}$. Presumably, zeroes of the
corresponding global $L$-factors should be subjected to an arithmetic version
of the Bethe ansatz equations.
