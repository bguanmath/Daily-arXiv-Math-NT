Semifinite case", "comment": null, "summary": "Let $\\mathbb{N}$ be a set of the natural numbers.\n  Symmetric inverse semigroup $R_\\infty$ is the semigroup of all infinite 0-1\nmatrices $[g_{ij}]$ with at most one 1 in each row and each column such that\n$g_{ii}=1$ on the complement of a finite set. The binary operation in\n$R_\\infty$ is the ordinary matrix multiplication. It is clear that infinite\nsymmetric group $\\mathfrak{S}_\\infty$ is a subgroup of $R_\\infty$. The map\n$\\star:\\left[ g_{ij}\\right]\\mapsto\\left[ g_{ji}\\right]$ is an involution on\n$R_\\infty$. We call a function $f$ on $R_\\infty$ positive definite if for all\n$r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\in R_\\infty$ the matrix $\\left[ f\\left(\nr_ir_j^\\star\\right)\\right]$ is Hermitian and positive semi-definite. A function\n$f$ said to be indecomposable if the corresponding $\\ast$-representation\n$\\pi_f$ is a factor-representation. A class of the\n$\\mathfrak{S}_\\infty$-invariant functions is defined by the condition\n$f(rs)=f(sr)$ for all $r\\in R_\\infty$ and $s\\in\\mathfrak{S}_\\infty$. In this\npaper we classify all semifinite factor-representations of $R_\\infty$ that\ncorrespond to the $\\mathfrak{S}_\\infty$-invariant positive definite functions."}

The\nseparating variety $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of\npairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its\ngeometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e.\nsets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of\ninvariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in\nthe important special case where $G=\\mathrm{GL}_p(\\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set\n$V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \\times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We\ndefine a purely combinatorial poset, $\\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal\nelements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension\n$(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular\nwe show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \\geq 3$, or $n \\geq 2$ and $p\n\\geq 4$. In the case $n \\geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components\nof given codimension in $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular\nshow that when $n\\geq 2$ and $p\\geq 4$, or $n\\geq 3$ and $p=3$,\n$\\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set.\nIt was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \\geq 4$ and\n$p=2$. The author made a conjecture in arXiv:2211.17088 generalising the\nSkronowski-Weyman theorem for representations of quivers. The results of this\npaper prove that conjecture in two important special cases: for the quiver with\none vertex and an arbitrary number, $n$, of loops, and for the quiver with two\nvertices and $n$ arrows between them."}
