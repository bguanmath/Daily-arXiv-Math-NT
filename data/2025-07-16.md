### [1] [Multiplicity free induction for the pairs $(\mathrm{GL}_{2}\times\mathrm{GL}_{2},\mathrm{diag}(\mathrm{GL}_{2}))$ and $(\mathrm{SL}_{3},\mathrm{GL}_{2})$ over finite fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10790)

Abstract: We classify the irredible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ for which
the induction to the product group
$\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)\times\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$, under the diagonal embedding,
decomposes multiplicity free. It turns out that only the irreducible
representations of dimensions $1$ and $q-1$ have this property. We show that
for $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ embedded into $\mathrm{SL}_{3}(q)$ via
$g\mapsto\mathrm{diag}(g,\det g^{-1})$ none of the irreducible representations
of $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ induce multiplicity free. In contrast, over the complex
numbers, the holomorphic representation theory of these pairs is multiplicity
free and the corresponding matrix coefficients are encoded by vector-valued
Jacobi polynomials. We show that similar results cannot be expected in the
context of finite fields for these examples.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Derivations of twisted loop algebras of minimal Q-graded subalgebras of
semisimple Lie algebras are investigated, and a decomposition formula of the
derivation algebra is obtained. Homogenous almost inner derivations of twisted
loop algebras and twisted affinizations of these Lie algebras are determined.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the validity of the local theta correspondence over a
non-archimedean local field in the context of modular representation theory
\textit{i.e.} for representations with coefficient fields of positive
characteristic. For a symplectic-orthogonal or a unitary-unitary dual pair over
a $p$-adic field, we obtain a bijective correspondence, as long as the
characteristic of the coefficient field is large enough compared to the size of
the dual pair, and call it the modular local theta correspondence.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of characteristic $p > 0$. Balmer
and Gallauer's recent result on finite $p$-permutation resolutions of
$kG$-modules motivates the study of an intriguing new invariant; the
$p$-permutation dimension. Following Walsh's success with cyclic groups of
prime order, we compute the (global) $p$-permutation dimension of the Klein
4-group in characteristic $p := 2$, along with the dimensions for each of its
indecomposable modules.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$
elements. For a positive integer $n$, the polynomial $X^n - 1 \in
\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is termed $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if all its
irreducible factors in $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ are either binomials or trinomials. In
2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $X^n
- 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$. Recently, the
author provided a complete characterization for odd $q$. This paper extends the
investigation to finite fields of even characteristic, fully determining all
$n$ such that $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for even $q$. This work
resolves two open problems posed by Oliveira and Reis for even characteristic
case.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated
$L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for
primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We that under the assumption of an
exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for
any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic
$$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$
holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$,
the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$.
Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes
(by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above
asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$
(i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption
that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$,
respectively.

Abstract: We prove the murmuration phenomenon, which is a correlation between signs of
functional equations and Fourier coefficients, in the case of modular forms in
the weight aspect. We in particular improve the range of visibility of
murmurations compared to previous results. This is the first approach to the
murmuration phenomenon using a relative trace formula, showing its robustness.

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in
sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may
be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field.
Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and
Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that
the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are
Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than
$B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results
of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer
zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood
asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal
result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.
