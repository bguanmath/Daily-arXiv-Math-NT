Comments are welcome", "summary": "A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den\nBergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of\ndouble Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson\nbrackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer\ndeveloped and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption\nthat there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first\nmain result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed\ndouble Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the\napproach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double\nPoisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is\nacyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory\ncan be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson\nand gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A\nsecond focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex\nalgebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC\nversions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under\neach representation functor. Our second main result is the development of\ncohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues\nof the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More\nimportantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology\ntheories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application,\nwe compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC\nde Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we\ndescribe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson\nvertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors."}
