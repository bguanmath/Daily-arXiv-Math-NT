This will be the submitted version", "summary": "In the \\textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\\left(G_n\\right)_{n \\geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\\left(U_n(p,q)\\right)_{n \\geq 0}$ and $\\left(V_n(p,q)\\right)_{n \\geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers."}

We use this to prove a classification statement on preperiodic points for quadratic polynomials over cubic fields, extending previous work of Poonen, Faber, and the first author and Krumm."}

When $B=\\mathrm{M}_2(\\mathbb{Q})$ is split and $\\mathbf{h}=\\mathbf{h}^B$ has CM by an imaginary quadratic field, this allows us to develop the signed anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory for the base change $\\mathrm{BC}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(π_f)\\times \\mathrm{BC}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(π_g)\\times ψ$, where $ψ$ is a Hecke character of $K$. We formulate a signed Perrin-Riou-style Iwasawa main conjecture in this setting, and obtain a result on one inclusion in this conjecture. Our methods also allow us to extend Hsieh's construction of the balanced triple-product $p$-adic $L$-function to the trito-non-ordinary scenario, and to define its signed counterparts."}

This problem is known to be equivalent to determining the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator.\n  To approach this problem, we give a method to approximate orthogonal projections on V by those on finite dimensional subspaces.\n  This method provides an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [A,B], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are \"constant-angle one-shifted form\"."}
