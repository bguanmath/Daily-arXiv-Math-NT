The existence of\nsuch an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via\ncharacter theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of\nfield-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and\nthe Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a\nclassical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker\ncoefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their\nnon-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient.\n  We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite\nreciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the\nmain diagonal."}

As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers\n$(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous\nwork, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global\ndimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving\nsubcategories of $\\mathbb{K}Q/\\langle R \\rangle - \\text{mod}$, which happen to\nbe those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we\nnotice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly,\nintroduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one.\nTogether with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to\ndescribe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques\nlet us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any\ncollection of indecomposable $\\mathbb{K}Q/\\langle R\\rangle$-modules."}
