We begin by treating a group action analog of the Burnside\nproblem for torsion groups using the p-adic arc method. We then prove some\nresults connecting commonality of preperiodic points for elements of an\nautomorphism group with structural properties of the group; these results are\nrelated to well-known results of Tits and Borel. We finish by proving some\nNorthcott-type results for finite morphisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u6709\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d89\u53camorphisms\uff08\u5f62\u6001\uff09\u7684\u9884\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528p\u8fdb\u6570\u5f27\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u71c3\u70e7\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f5c\u7528\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u9650\u5f62\u6001\u7684Northcott\u578b\u7ed3\u679c.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0eTits\u548cBorel\u7684\u8457\u540d\u7ed3\u679c\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027.", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u7684p\u8fdb\u6570\u5f27\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5176\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u5185\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u9884\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5Northcott\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e2e\u52a9\u786e\u8ba4\u6709\u9650\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u7279\u6027.", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5173\u4e8emorphisms\u7684\u9884\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Northcott\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6709\u9650morphisms\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528.", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9884\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Northcott\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u6709\u9650morphism\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f5c\u7528\u7ed3\u8bba."}}
