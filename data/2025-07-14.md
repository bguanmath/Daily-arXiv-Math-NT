Abstract: In this article, we give a family of examples of algebras, showing that for
every $n \geq 2$ and $m \geq 0$, there is an algebra displaying a path of n
irreducible morphisms between indecomposable modules whose composite lies in
the $(n+m+3)$-th power of the radical, but not in the $(n + m + 4)$-th power.
Such an algebra may be also supposed to be string and representation-finite.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper we prove theorems characterizing the decomposition of
equivariant feature spaces, filters and a structural preservation theorem for
invariant subspace chains in group equivariant convolutional neural
networks(G-CNN). Furthermore, we give explicit matrix forms for irreducible
representations of $UT_3(\F_3)$-the unitriangular matrix groups over the field
with three elements. These results provide a foundation for designing new G-CNN
architectures via representations of $UT_3(\F_3)$ that respect deep algebraic
structure, with potential applications in symbolic visual learning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let ${\mathbb{G}}$ be a simply connected ${\mathbb{Z}}_\ell$-spets, let $q$
be a prime power, prime to $\ell$ and let $S$ be the underlying Sylow
$\ell$-subgroup. Firstly, motivated by known formulae for values of
Deligne-Lusztig characters of finite reductive groups, we propose a formula for
the values of the unipotent characters of ${\mathbb{G}}(q)$ on the elements of
$S$. Using this, we explicitly list the unipotent character values of the
${\mathbb{Z}}_2$-spets $G_{24}(q)$ related to the Benson-Solomon fusion system
Sol$(q)$.
  Secondly, when $\ell > 2$ is a very good prime for ${\mathbb{G}}$, the Weyl
group $W$ of ${\mathbb{G}}$ has order coprime with $\ell$, and
$q\equiv1\pmod\ell$ we introduce a formula for the values of characters in the
principal block of ${\mathbb{G}}(q)$ which extends the Curtis-Schewe type
formulae for groups of Lie type, and which we show to satisfy a version of
block orthogonality.
  In both cases we formulate and provide evidence for several conjectures
concerning the proposed values.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ratios of D-finite sequences and their limits -- known as Ap\'ery limits --
have driven much of the work on irrationality proofs since Ap\'ery's 1979
breakthrough proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$. We extend ratios of
D-finite sequences to a high-dimensional setting by introducing the
Conservative Matrix Field (CMF). We demonstrate how classical Ap\'ery limits
are included by this object as special cases. A useful construction of CMFs is
provided, drawing a connection to gauge transformations and to representations
of shift operators in finite dimensional modules of Ore algebras. Finally,
numerical experiments on these objects reveal surprising arithmetic and
dynamical phenomena, which are formulated into conjectures. If established,
these conjectures would extend Poincar\'e--Perron asymptotics to higher
dimensions, potentially opening the door to optimization-based searches for new
irrationality proofs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the $p$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values
of an imaginary quadratic field at an inert prime $p$ along the anticyclotomic
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower. The key is determination of the $p$-adic valuation of
generalized Gauss sums defined using Coates-Wiles homomorphism, and of local
resolvents in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. This answers a question of Rubin.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is proved that \[ \sum_{\chi \bmod q}N(\sigma , T, \chi)
\lesssim_{\epsilon} (qT)^{7(1-\sigma)/3+\epsilon}, \] where $N(\sigma, T,
\chi)$ denote the number of zeros $\rho = \beta + it$ of $L(s, \chi)$ in the
rectangle $\sigma \leq \beta \leq 1$, $|t| \leq T$. The exponent $7/3$ improves
upon Huxley's earlier exponent of $12/5$. The key innovation lies in deriving a
sharp upper bound for sums involving affine transformations with GCD twists,
which emerges from our application of the Guth-Maynard method. As corollaries,
we obtain two new arithmetic consequences from this zero-density estimate:
first, a result concerning the least prime in arithmetic progressions when the
modulus is a prime power; second, a result on the least Goldbach number in
arithmetic progressions when the modulus is prime.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In a previous paper, we provided an explicit description of the arboreal
Galois group of the postcritically finite polynomial $f(z) = z^2 +c$ in the
special case when the critical point $0$ is periodic under the action of
$f(z)$. In the current paper, we complete the picture for all postcritically
finite polynomials by addressing the cases when $0$ is strictly preperiodic for
the polynomial $f(z)$.

### [9] [Counting the number of $2$-periodic integral points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08601)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set
of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by
$\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient
$c$, where $d>2$ is an integer. As in the previous articles, we again wish to
study here counting problems that are inspired by exciting advances of
Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $2$-torsion
point-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture and
Panraksa's work on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing
so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$, the average number
of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any polynomial map $\varphi_{p, c}$
modulo $p$ is either zero or unbounded as $c$ tends to infinity. Furthermore,
inspired by a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any
polynomial map $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic
dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic
integral points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is equal to $1$ or $2$ or
$0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, as in the previous follow-up articles,
we then also apply here density and number field-counting results from
arithmetic statistics, and consequently obtain again several counting and
statistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and on the
algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.

### [10] [Upper tail distributions of central $L$-values of quadratic twists of elliptic curves at the variance scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08640)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the large deviations at the order of the variance for the central
value of a family of $L$-functions among the members with bounded discriminant.
When there is an upper bound on an integer moment of the central value twisted
by a short Dirichlet polynomial, we can establish upper bounds on the density
of members exhibiting a large central value. We adapt the techniques from
Arguin and Bailey for large deviations of the Riemann zeta function to prove
results on the degree two family of quadratic twists of an elliptic curve. This
upper bound improves on density results previously obtained by Radziwi\l{\l}
and Soundararajan.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索4元素整数集合的和集大小分布规律，发现其与四面体数差值的关联。

Method: 通过实验计算提出假设，随后进行理论证明并构造具体的h-进制定义集合以验证这些和集大小。

Result: 证明了这些‘流行’的和集大小确实存在，并为每个数构造了明确的h-进制定义集合。

Conclusion: 结论指出4元素整数集合的和集大小主要由四面体数的差值决定，且存在特定的构造方法。

Abstract: Experimental calculations suggest that the $h$-fold sumset sizes of 4-element
sets of integers are concentrated at $h$ numbers that are differences of
tetrahedral numbers. In this paper it is proved that these "popular" sumset
sizes exist and explicit $h$-adically defined sets are constructed for each of
these numbers.

Abstract: We develop a reduction theory for the representation of $\mathrm{SL}_n$ on
pairs of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. We apply this theory to the pencils of
quadrics arising from divisors on hyperelliptic curves. We use these results to
show that, in a density $1$ family, an odd degree point $P$ of degree at most
$2g-1$ on the hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f_0x^{2g+2} + f_1 x^{2g+1} y + \cdots
+ f_{2g+2}y^{2g+2}$ cannot have small Weil height.

### [13] [Functional equations of axiomatic multiple Dirichlet series, Weyl groupoids, and quantum algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08662)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove functional equations for multiple Dirichlet series defined by a
collection of five geometric axioms. We find functional equations of two types:
one modeled on the functional equations of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and another
modeled on the functional equations of Kubota $L$-series with Gauss sums as
coefficients. These functional equations generate groupoid structures, which we
relate to the Weyl groupoids of arithmetic root systems. From the known
classification of arithmetic root systems, we obtain a complete classification
of multiple Dirichlet series which can be used to compute moments of
$L$-functions via established analytic techniques. Our classification includes
all moments of $L$-functions which have appeared in the multiple Dirichlet
series literature previously, alongside some new moments. Finally, we give
applications of our functional equations to quantum algebra, specifically the
cohomology of Nichols algebras.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we prove analogues of the Dirichlet theorem on arithmetic
progressions and the Siegel--Walfisz theorem for the digital reverses of primes
for arbitrary bases, which the authors obtained in the previous paper but only
for large bases. The proof is based on a generalization of the result of
Martin--Mauduit--Rivat (2014) on the exponential sums over primes with the
so-called ``digital'' functions.
