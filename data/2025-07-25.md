Abstract: We study modular forms for $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ with no negative
Fourier coefficients. Let $A(k)$ be the positive integer where if the first
$A(k)$ Fourier coefficients of a modular form of weight $k$ for
$\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ are nonnegative, then all of its Fourier
coefficients are nonnegative, so that $A(k)$ can be interpreted as a
``nonnegativity Sturm bound''. We give upper and lower bounds for $A(k)$, as
well as an upper bound on the $n$th Fourier coefficient of any form with no
negative Fourier coefficients.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B,
with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images
of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over
$\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in
\{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to
understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained
in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to
determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we
consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of
genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a
correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive
integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$,
the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of
several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification
of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single
plane quartic.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the Enhanced Multidimensional Chaotic Heuristic Sieve (EMCHS), a
novel probabilistic framework that integrates chaotic perturbations and random
matrix theory (RMT) to suggest improved bounds on prime gaps. Building upon the
foundational sieves of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim and Maynard, EMCHS heuristically
suggests unconditional gaps of at most 180 and conditional gaps of at most 8
under a partial Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (EHC) with delta = 0.3. These
heuristic suggestions surpass Maynard's unconditional bound of 246 through
refined polytope optimizations and probabilistic enhancements. We provide
rigorous proofs for certain analytic components (such as bounding chaotic
perturbations via ergodic theory) and explicitly distinguish which arguments
and conclusions are heuristic or conjectural. Numerical evidence for primes up
to 10^18 supports the framework, and we discuss limitations and avenues for
future rigorous work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We generalize the Cannonball Problem by introducing integer-valued and
non-increasing arithmetic functions $w$. We associate these functions $w$ with
certain polygons, which we call cannonball polygons. Through this
correspondence, we show that for any $Z\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a
cannonball polygon with multiplicity 8 and largest side of length $Z$.
Moreover, for any multiplicity $s$ greater than 8, we provide an asymptotic
formula for the number of distinct classes of cannonball polygons with
multiplicity $s$.

Abstract: In 1914, Hardy proved that there are infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the
Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line Re$(s)=1/2$ using the
Jacobi theta relation. In this paper, we first establish a number field
analogue of the Jacobi theta relation and as an application, we show the
existence of infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the Dedekind zeta function
$\zeta_\mathbb{F}(s)$ on Re$(s)=1/2$, for any number field $\mathbb{F}$. Quite
interestingly, we also prove that the Jacobi theta relation is equivalent to an
intriguing identity of Hardy, Littlewood and Ramanujan.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Laurent series expansions of complex functions play a crucial role in
analyzing their behavior near poles. In particular, Laurent series expansions
have been extensively studied in the theory of zeta-functions. It is well known
that the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann zeta-function features the
Euler-Stieltjes constants in its coefficients. Similar phenomena occur in the
Laurent series expansion of the Hurwitz zeta-function, which is of considerable
interest.
  In this paper, we compute the Laurent series expansions of the Barnes double
zeta-function $ \zeta_2 (s, \alpha ; v, w ) $ at $s=1$ and $s=2$, and show that
a constant analogous to the Euler-Stieltjes constant appears in the constant
term.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are used to generate secret keys in
stream cipher cryptosystems. There are different kinds of key-stream generators
like filter generators, combination generators, clock-controlled generators,
etc. For a combination generator, the connection polynomial is the product of
the connection polynomials of constituent LFSRs. For better cryptographic
properties, the connection polynomials of the constituent LFSRs should be
primitive with coprime degrees. The cryptographic systems using LFSRs as their
components are vulnerable to correlation attacks. The attack heavily depends on
the $t$-nomial multiples of the connection polynomial for small values of $t$.
In 2005, Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu provided a lower bound for the number
of $t$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials over GF(2). The
lower bound is exact when $t=3$. In this article, we provide the exact number
of $4$-nomial and $5$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials.
This helps us to choose a more suitable connection polynomial to resist the
correlation attacks. Next, we disprove a conjecture by Maitra, Gupta, and
Venkateswarlu.

Abstract: We prove that there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic elliptic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ sharing the same BSD invariants -- including their
$L$-functions, Mordell--Weil groups, Tate--Shafarevich groups, Tamagawa
numbers, regulators, and real periods -- and their Kodaira symbols and minimal
discriminants, while having distinct $j$-invariants.

Abstract: Let $p>3$ be a prime, and let $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ be the Legendre symbol. Let
$A_p(x)$ denote the matrix $[x+a_{ij}]_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant (p-1)/2}$,
where $$ a_{ij}=\begin{cases} (\frac{j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i=1, \$\frac{i+j}{p})
&\text{if} \ i>1. \end{cases}$$ In 2018 Z.-W. Sun conjectured that $\det
A_p(0)=-2^{(p-3)/2}$ if $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, which was later confirmed by G.
Zaimi. In this paper we evaluate $\det A_p(x)$ completely.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider Borcherds algebras with no real roots and the property that all
zeroes in the Borcherds Cartan matrix occur in a single diagonal zero block. It
follows that all other entries of the matrix are negative. We give a structure
theorem for these Borcherds algebras, decomposing them into free, Heisenberg
and abelian subalgebras. We show that a class of such Borcherds algebras are
the Monstrous Lie algebras associated to non-Fricke elements of the Monster
finite simple group. This new perspective on their structure gives an efficient
method to compute their twisted denominator formulas.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected
reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective
space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the
categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation
$(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the
algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V,
\mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the
representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is
an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra
$\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of
the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential
$\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of
the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant
differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The
main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories
between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left(
V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $
and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules
modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization
of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an
algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic
$\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of
skew-symmetric matrices.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Sakellaridis-Venkatesh conjecture for the rank-1
spherical variety $X=\text{Spin}_9\backslash F_4$ using an exceptional theta
correspondence. We establish the correct transfer map satisfying relative
character identities in this case and show that our transfer map agrees with
the formula in (Sakellaridis, 2021). Moreover, we show how our techniques lead
to a characterization of $X$-relatively cuspidal representations.
