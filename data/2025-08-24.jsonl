Vashaw", "Justin Zhang"], "title": "Non-negligible summands in tensor powers of some modular representations of finite $p$-groups", "comment": "20 pages, comments welcome", "summary": "Let $p>0$ be a prime, $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $\\Bbbk$ be an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. Dave Benson has conjectured\nthat if $p=2$ and $V$ is an odd-dimensional indecomposable representation of\n$G$ then all summands of the tensor product $V \\otimes V^*$ except for $\\Bbbk$\nhave even dimension. It is known that the analogous result for general $p$ is\nfalse. In this paper, we investigate the class of graded representations $V$\nwhich have dimension coprime to $p$ and for which $V \\otimes V^*$ has a\nnon-trivial summand of dimension coprime to $p$, for a graded group scheme\nclosely related to $\\mathbb{Z}/p^r \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p^s\n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $p>2$. We produce\nan infinite family of such representations in characteristic 3 and show in\nparticular that the tensor subcategory generated by any of these\nrepresentations in the semisimplification contains the modulo $3$ reduction of\nthe category of representations of the symmetric group $S_3$. Our results are\ncompatible with a general version of Benson's conjecture due to Etingof."}

This gives an\nexplicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by\neach pencil."}
