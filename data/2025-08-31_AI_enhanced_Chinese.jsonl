Building on the original Zeckendorf game\\ -- previously studied in the\ncontext of unordered multisets\\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must\nrespect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced\nstrategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.\n  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all\n$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable\nstructure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n\n\\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes\nis driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit\nallowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a\nswitching move that reorders pairs.\n  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\\ --\nnow in ascending order\\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.\nWe further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has\nlength exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the\nZeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic\ngrowth, with $M(n) \\sim \\frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit\nlog-normal convergence in their move distributions.
