The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules.\n  This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras.\n  The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework."}

We prove that if $n = p^k m$ where $p = \\operatorname{char}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\\gcd(m, p)=1$, then $h_q(p^k m) = 0$ if and only if $h_q(m) = 0$. This result fully reduces the non-coprime case to the coprime case settled by Huang. Our proof employs the structure theory of cyclic group algebras in modular characteristic."}

First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \\mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices."}

For this, we use the theory of Hecke series for a reductive group over nonarchimedean local fields, which was developed by Andrianov and Hina-Sugano. By treating the Euler factors of the counting Dirichlet series for lattices, we obtain zeta functions of classical groups, which were earlier studied with $p$-adic cone integrals. When our counting series equals the existing zeta functions of groups, we recover the known results in a simple way. Further we obtain some new zeta functions for non-split even orthogonal and odd orthogonal groups."}

Similarly, for an odd prime power $p^k$, we calculate the possible values for the number of points above some $j$-invariant on Cartan modular curves $X_{\\mathrm s}(p^k)$, $X_{\\mathrm{ns}}(p^k)$ and their normalizers.\n  Combining known results about images of Galois representations of CM elliptic curves with our work, we also devise a simple algorithm to determine the number of rational CM points on any modular curve."}

Let $K/k$ be a Galois extension of number fields with Galois group isomorphic to $G$, and let $C \\subseteq \\mathrm{Gal}(K/k) \\simeq G$ be a conjugacy invariant subset. It is well known that there exists an unramified prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $k$ with Frobenius element lying in $C$ and norm satisfying $\\mathrm{N}\\mathfrak{p} \\ll |\\mathrm{Disc}(K)|^α$ for some constant $α= α(G,C)$. There is a rich literature establishing unconditional admissible values for $α$, with most approaches proceeding by studying the zeros of $L$-functions. We give an alternative approach, not relying on zeros, that often substantially improves this exponent $α$ for any fixed finite group $G$, provided $C$ is a union of rational equivalence classes. As a particularly striking example, we prove that there exist absolute constants $c_1,c_2 > 0$ such that for any $n\\geq 2$ and any conjugacy class $C \\subset S_n$, one may take $α(S_n,C) = c_1 \\exp(-c_2n)$.
