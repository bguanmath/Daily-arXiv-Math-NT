Precisely, assume that $R$ is a right\nnoetherian ring and $f: M\\rt N$ is a morphism of finitely generated right\n$R$-modules. The first theorem proves that the natural transformation\n$\\Ext^1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of finitely generated right\n$R$-modules if and only if $\\Tor_1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of\nfinitely generated left $R$-modules. As a corollary of this result, we\nestablish that $\\Ext^1(f, -)$ is epic if and only if $\\Tor_1(f, -)$ is monic.\nThe second theorem shows that if $R$ is left and right noetherian and $M, N$\nare Gorenstein projective, then the natural transformations $\\Tor_1(f, -)$,\n$\\Ext^1(-, f)$ and $\\Ext^1(f, -)$ vanish over the category of finitely\ngenerated Gorenstein projective modules, simultaneously. This, in particular,\nyields that over Gorenstein projective modules, the notions of phantom\nmorphisms and $\\Ext$-phantom morphisms coincide. Also, it is proved that if $R$\nis $n$-Gorenstein, then for any integer $i>n$, the natural transformations\n$\\Ext^{i}(f, -)$, $\\Ext^{i}(-, f)$ and $\\Tor_{i}(f, -)$ vanish over finitely\ngenerated modules, simultaneously. As an interesting consequence, we show that\nunder the same assumptions, $\\Ext^i(-, f)$ is epic (resp. monic) if and only if\n$\\Ext^i(f, -)$ is monic (resp. epic) if and only if $\\Tor_i(f, -)$ is epic\n(resp. monic)."}
