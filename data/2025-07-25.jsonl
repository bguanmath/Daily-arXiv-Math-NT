Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \\in\n\\{2,3,13,17\\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to\nunderstand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained\nin the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to\ndetermining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we\nconsider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of\ngenus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a\ncorrespondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive\ninteger solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$,\nthe resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of\nseveral genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification\nof $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single\nplane quartic."}

We provide\nrigorous proofs for certain analytic components (such as bounding chaotic\nperturbations via ergodic theory) and explicitly distinguish which arguments\nand conclusions are heuristic or conjectural.
