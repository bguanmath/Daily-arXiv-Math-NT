Abstract: We consider Euclidean lattices spanned by images of algebraic conjugates of
an algebraic number under Minkowski embedding, investigating their rank,
properties of their automorphism groups and sets of minimal vectors. We are
especially interested in situations when the resulting lattice is well-rounded.
We show that this happens for large Pisot numbers of prime degree,
demonstrating infinite families of such lattices. We also fully classify
well-rounded lattices from algebraic conjugates in the 2-dimensional case and
present various examples in the 3-dimensional case. Finally, we derive a
determinant formula for the resulting lattice in the case when the minimal
polynomial of an algebraic number has its Galois group of a particular type.

Abstract: We investigate cases where Thabit and Williams numbers in base $b$ can be
expressed as the sum or difference of two $g$-repdigits. For specific values of
$b$ and $g$, we describe parametric solutions yielding infinitely many
solutions for some equations and establish upper bounds for the parameters of
the remaining finitely many solutions. As an illustration, we also provide a
complete solution for some equations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give a classification of the degrees of the points with rational
$j$-invariant on the modular curves $X_{0}(n)$ and $X_{1}(n)$. The degrees
which occur infinitely often are computed unconditionally, while those which
occur finitely often are determined assuming a conjecture of Zywina. To achieve
this, we define the notion of $\mathcal{H}$-closures of subgroups of
$\operatorname{GL}_{2}(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$, and compute the
$\mathcal{B}_{0}(n)$- and $\mathcal{B}_{1}(n)$-closures of images of Galois
representations of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. An application to
computing the set of isolated $j$-invariants in $\mathbb{Q}$ is also given.

### [6] [The cohomological Kudla conjecture for unitary Shimura varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13299)
*François Greer,Salim Tayou*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: A paper in algebraic number theory, discussing the construction and properties of cohomology class generating series and their relation to modular forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the Kudla--Millson generating series to compactified unitary Shimura varieties, with the motivation of proving the cohomological version of a conjecture by Kudla and Bruinier--Rosu--Zemel regarding the modular nature of such generating series and the theory of Zariski closures of special cycles.

Method: The authors construct natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson series and demonstrate that these extensions are holomorphic Hermitian modular forms. They also develop the theory of Hermitian quasi-modular forms, particularly focusing on polynomial weighted theta functions, to prove the modular nature of the generating series involving Zariski closures.

Result: The paper shows that the natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson generating series for cohomology classes in compactified unitary Shimura varieties are holomorphic Hermitian modular forms. Additionally, they prove that the generating series of Zariski closures of special cycles is a Hermitian quasi-modular form.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates the cohomological interpretation of the Kudla--Millson series as modular forms and contributes to the understanding of the modular properties of the Zariski closures in the context of Hermitian quasi-modular forms.

Abstract: We construct natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson generating series of
cohomology classes of special cycles in compactified unitary Shimura varieties
of signature $(n+1,1)$ and prove that they are holomorphic Hermitian modular
forms. This proves the cohomological version of a conjecture of Kudla and
Bruinier--Rosu--Zemel, in all codimensions up to the middle. We also develop
the theory of Hermitian quasi-modular forms, with a particular focus on
polynomial weighted theta functions, and prove that the generating series of
Zariski closures of special cycles is a Hermitian quasi-modular form.

### [7] [Subcategories of Module Categories via Restricted Yoneda Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12778)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a framework for producing interesting subcategories of the
category ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ of left $A$-modules, where $A$ is an associative
algebra over a field $k$. The construction is based on the composition, $Y$, of
the Yoneda embedding of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ with a restriction to certain
subcategories $\mathcal{B}\subset {}_A\mathsf{Mod}$, typically consisting of
cyclic modules. We describe the subcategories on which $Y$ provides an
equivalence of categories. This also provides a way to understand the
subcategories of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ that arise this way. Many well-known
categories are obtained in this way, including categories of weight modules and
Harish-Chandra modules with respect to a subalgebra $\Gamma$ of $A$. In other
special cases the equivalence involves modules over the Mickelsson step algebra
associated to a reductive pair of Lie algebras.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We continue the study of cactus flower moduli spaces $\overline{F}_n$ and
Gaudin models started in arXiv:2308.06880, arXiv:2407.06424. We show that
isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form
$\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes
of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories
that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and
finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any
complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara
$\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings
given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we
compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over
two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights,
this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture
of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions
in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.

### [9] [A basis and Schur-Weyl duality for the loop Hecke algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12839)
*Geoffrey Janssens,Abel Lacabanne,Léo Schelstraete,Pedro Vaz*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra with a basis and offers insights into the use of quantum gl_{1|1} for its representation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The loop Hecke algebra, being a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop braid group, presents a novel field of study within algebra. The motivation could be to expand the understanding and applications of Hecke algebras in the context of more complex structures like loop braid groups.

Method: The authors utilize higher linear rewriting theory to demonstrate the linear independence and employ the combinatorics of Dyck paths to calculate the cardinality of the basis.

Result: The paper provides a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra and a basis under a mild condition on the parameter. Additionally, a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowell is proven.

Conclusion: The research advances the structural and representation theoretic comprehension of the loop Hecke algebra, leveraging both linear rewriting theory and quantum gl_{1|1} duality. This opens new avenues for exploring algebras related to loop braid groups.

Abstract: The loop Hecke algebra is a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop
braid group, introduced by Damiani, Martin and Rowell. We give a new
presentation of the loop Hecke algebra provided a mild condition on the
parameter and give a basis. We use higher linear rewriting theory to show
linear independence and the combinatorics of Dyck paths to compute the
cardinality of the basis. This yields a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowel. We
also give a representation theoretic interpretation of the loop Hecke algebra
in terms of (non-semisimple) Schur-Weyl duality involving the negative half of
quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$.

### [10] [$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part II: Central extensions and exceptionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12923)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group,
acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from
arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast
G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra. We
consider the subgroups arising from $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})
\hookrightarrow \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as
the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we
show that a $3$-preprojective structure exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$
is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or
$\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E)
-- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure, except for type
(H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of
isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay
quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional
subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we
discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new
examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with
arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the
classification of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for
which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present new techniques for removing arrows of bound quiver algebras,
reducing thus the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ for a given
algebra to a smaller one. Unlike the classic arrow removal operation of
Green-Psaroudakis-Solberg, our methods allow for removing arrows even when they
occur in every generating set for the defining admissible ideal of the algebra.
Our first main result establishes an equivalence for the finiteness of the
finitistic (and global) dimensions of a ring $\Lambda$ and its quotient
$\Lambda/K$, under specific homological and structural conditions on the ideal
$K$, in the broader context of left artinian rings. The application of this
result to bound quiver algebras suggests the notion of removability for sets of
arrows, and we prove that successive arrow removals of this sort lead to a
uniquely defined arrow reduced version of the algebra. Towards the opposite
direction, we characterize generalized arrow removal algebras via removable
multiplicative bimodules, and introduce trivial one-arrow extensions as a novel
combinatorial construction for adding arrows while preserving the finiteness of
the finitistic (and global) dimensions. All these new techniques are
illustrated through various concrete bound quiver algebras, for which
confirming the $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ had previously seemed intractable to the best
of our knowledge.
