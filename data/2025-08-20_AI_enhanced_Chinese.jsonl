The\nseparating variety $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of\npairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its\ngeometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e.\nsets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of\ninvariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in\nthe important special case where $G=\\mathrm{GL}_p(\\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set\n$V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \\times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We\ndefine a purely combinatorial poset, $\\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal\nelements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension\n$(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular\nwe show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \\geq 3$, or $n \\geq 2$ and $p\n\\geq 4$. In the case $n \\geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components\nof given codimension in $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular\nshow that when $n\\geq 2$ and $p\\geq 4$, or $n\\geq 3$ and $p=3$,\n$\\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set.\nIt was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \\geq 4$ and\n$p=2$.
