Since the early 1990s, such classical good\nintegers have been studied intensively for their number theoretic structures\nand for applications, notably in coding theory. This work completes the study\nby relaxing the coprimality hypothesis and treating the non-coprime case\n$\\gcd(a,b)\\neq1$ in a concise and self-contained way. The results are presented\nin terms of the classical coprime criterion and $p$-adic valuations of $\\ell$.\nAs a consequence, whenever $\\ell$ is good, all admissible exponents form a\nsingle arithmetic progression with an explicit starting point and period. Some\nspecial cases are discussed in the non-coprime setting. A practical decision\nprocedure is developed that decides the goodness of a given integer and\nexplicitly enumerates the full set of admissible exponents. Several\nillustrative examples are presented."}
