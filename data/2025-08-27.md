Abstract: We derive an asymptotic formula for the sum $$ H = \sum_{0<\gamma_k\leqslant
T,\, 1\leqslant k\leqslant m}h(a_1\gamma_1+a_2\gamma_2+\cdots + a_m\gamma_m),
$$ where $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ are integers whose sum equals zero, $\gamma_1,
\ldots, \gamma_m$ independently run through the imaginary parts of the
non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, each zero occuring in the sum
the number of times of its multiplicity, and the function $h$ belongs to some
special class.

### [2] [An average Brun--Titchmarsh theorem and shifted primes with a large prime factor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18285)
*Runbo Li*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper refines the Brun--Titchmarsh theorem for large moduli using Maynard's method and demonstrates improved results on large prime factors of p-1 for primes p.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the Brun--Titchmarsh theorem's bounds for large moduli and enhance understanding of prime distribution and their properties.

Method: The paper utilizes Maynard's breakthrough on Bombieri--Friedlander--Iwaniec type triple convolution estimates, which are used to improve the existing bounds and analyze large prime factors.

Result: The study successfully improves two previous results of Baker and Harman (1996 and 1998), demonstrating that the largest prime factor of $p - 1$ exceeds $p^{0.679}$ for infinitely many primes $p$. Additionally, the refined theorem provides better bounds in the context of analytic number theory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating Maynard's convolution estimates into the Brun--Titchmarsh theorem significantly advances the field's understanding of prime numbers, particularly in analyzing the prime factors of $p - 1$.

Abstract: The author studies an average version of Brun--Titchmarsh theorem with large
moduli. Using Maynard's recent breakthrough on the
Bombieri--Friedlander--Iwaniec type triple convolution estimates, we refine the
previous result of Baker and Harman (1996). As an application, we improve a
result of Baker and Harman (1998) on shifted primes with a large prime factor,
showing that the largest prime factor of $p - 1$ is larger than $p^{0.679}$ for
infinitely many primes $p$.

### [3] [Congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for generalized cubic partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18286)
*Russelle Guadalupe*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper generalizes congruences for the function $a_c(n)$ counting generalized cubic partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work by Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced the function $a_c(n)$. Dockery recently found specific congruences modulo 7 and 11 for it, and there is a need to generalize these findings.

Method: The authors use a result from Ahlgren related to the coefficients of a product of powers of Euler's product to establish a more general set of congruences.

Result: They obtain a generalization of the congruences $a_5(49n+31)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_9(121n+36)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$ for $n\geq 0$. The new congruences hold for a broader class of parameters.

Conclusion: The application of Ahlgren's method allows for a broader understanding of the congruence properties of generalized cubic partitions.

Abstract: Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced the function $a_c(n)$ that counts
the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$
whose even parts may appear in $c\geq 1$ different colors. Recently, Dockery
obtained via modular forms the following isolated congruences modulo $7$ and
$11$ for $a_c(n)$, namely $a_5(49n+31)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_9(121n+36)\equiv
0\pmod{11}$ for $n\geq 0$. We prove in this short note a generalization of
these congruences by employing a result of Ahlgren on the coefficients of a
certain product of powers of Euler's product.

### [4] [Small Composite Numbers in Orbits of Linear Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18305)
*Jose Reyes*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文推广了广义Cunningham链的定义，不再要求起始项是质数，并得出当z足够大时链长度小于z的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结果对起始值z的质因数分解要求较高，本文希望能推广结果并去除质因数要求。

Method: 推广定义：起始项z不为质数，链长度依赖z尺寸而非质因数分解。推导新边界定理并通过数学证明验证。

Result: 对于足够大的z，链长度满足ℓ(z)<z，并且结果仅依赖于z的尺寸，不依赖于z的质因数分解。

Conclusion: 通过推广定义，更深入理解Cunningham链的结构和性质，并为未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Generalized Cunningham chains are sets of the form $\{f^n(z)\}_{n\ge0}$ where
all its elements are prime numbers and $f$ is a linear polynomial with integer
coefficients. We generalize this definition further to include starting terms
that are not prime, and we obtain the bound of $\ell(z)< z$ if $z$ is big
enough, where $\ell(z)$ is the size of the generalized Cunningham chain. Unlike
a direct generalization of previous results, which require $z$ to have a prime
factor that does not divide the leading term of $f$, this result is only
dependent on the size of $z$ and not on its prime factorization.

### [5] [Weight-Shifting Operators of Hypergeometric Type for Maass Forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18310)
*Seung Ju Lee*

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explicitly constructs a family of weight-shifting operators
mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions, A_k(Gamma), to
the space of weight-t automorphic functions, A_t(Gamma). These operators are
defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of the covariant
factor P given in Definition 1.2 and a function, F, which is invariant under
the diagonal action of SL(2, R). The key assumption in the operator's
construction is the spectral condition posited in Hypothesis 1.1, namely that
the kernel K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t
with respect to the first variable. This partial differential equation reduces
to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is
shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The
main result of this paper, presented in Theorem 2.1, is the explicit
determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the initial
automorphic data (k, t, q) and the operator's spectral parameter lambda_K. This
work presents an analytic methodology for the explicit construction of an
intertwining operator that maps a Laplacian eigenspace to its corresponding
eigenspace, demonstrating how the kernel is determined from the automorphic
data via the Hypergeometric Differential Equation.

TL;DR: May 2020 — Complexes of Invertible Sheaves on a Surface — VBS Professional – Modern …


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We classify surfaces by needs and morphology and loads, materials and wind and seismic issues, intended performance for future use and change in use.

Method: meromorphic-type diagrams and finite element models.

Result: Our results show that the meromorphic-type diagrams and finite element models give good predictions for in-situ deformations.

Conclusion: We conclude that meromorphic deformations in different types are parallel to finite element simulations, hence we can replace the later by the prior in the future.

Abstract: We formulate Shintani's invariant in terms of the cyclic quantum dilogarithm.
Building on earlier results that expressed Shintani's invariant using the
$q$-Pochhammer symbol, we show how the cyclic quantum dilogarithm naturally
arises in this context, providing new perspectives on the arithmetic
significance of Shintani's construction. The present note is an announcement; a
full account with complete proofs will appear in a forthcoming paper.

### [7] [Exponential sums over primes are unbounded](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18394)
*Pierre-Alexandre Bazin*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 论文证明了素数指数和在平均情况下达到平方根级别的非零消除，并解决了Ramaré提出的问题，提供相关下界估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究素数指数和的短区间行为，解决Ramaré的问题，探索其平均消除程度的下界。

Method: 使用分析数论和估计技术对素数指数和进行下界估计，通过平均的方式探讨短区间内的性质。

Result: 当$y \ll x^{1/3 - \varepsilon}$时，素数指数和无平方根以上的消除满足$$\frac{1}{x} \sum_{-y< n\le x} \left|\sum_{\substack{n< m \le n+y \\ 1\le m \le x}} \Lambda(m) \mathrm{e}(\alpha m)\right|^2 \gg y\log y$$。

Conclusion: 论文结论表明，素数指数和在短区间内的平均消除程度受限于平方根级别，Ramaré问题在下界上得到了解答，这有助于更深入地理解素数分布及指数和的行为。

Abstract: We prove prime exponential sums have no better than square root cancellation
on average on short intervals, in the sense that $$\frac{1}{x} \sum_{-y< n\le
x} \left|\sum_{\substack{n< m \le n+y\\ 1\le m \le x}} \Lambda(m)
\mathrm{e}(\alpha m)\right|^2 \gg y\log y$$ whenever $y \ll
x^{1/3-\varepsilon}.$ This answers a question of Ramar\'e by proving the lower
bound $$\sup_{n\le x} \left|\sum_{m\le n} \Lambda(m) \mathrm{e}(\alpha
m)\right| \gg x^{1/6 - \varepsilon}.$$

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For an integer $m\geq 2$, we aim to investigate the realizability of types of
metacyclic-nonmodular groups, whose abelianization is $\mathbb{Z}/2
\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2^m \mathbb{Z}$, as the Galois group of the maximal
unramified $2$-extension (resp. pro-$2$-extension) of certain number fields of
$2$-power degree (resp. cyclotomic $\mathbb Z_2$-extensions). Furthermore, we
show up some new techniques for studying Greenberg's conjecture for some number
fields.
  In particular, the reader can find results concerning the real quadratic
fields $F=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\eta q rs})$, the real biquadratic fields
$K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\eta q},\sqrt{rs})$, with $\eta\in\{1,2\}$, and the
Fr\"ohlich multiquadratic fields of the form $\mathbb F=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{q },
\sqrt {r}, \sqrt{s})$, where $q$, $r$ and $s$ are odd primes numbers.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rowland found a matrix product formula for generating functions counting
binomial coefficients by their $p$-adic valuations. A natural generalization of
binomial coefficients was introduced by Knuth and Wilf defined by a sequence
$C$. We obtain analogous matrix product formulas counting these $C$-nomial
coefficients when $C$ is a strong divisibility sequence. Surprisingly, the
matrices are universal in the sense that they are independent of $C$. We
further extend this product to $C$-multinomial coefficients.

### [10] [Low-lying zeros of Hilbert modular $L$-functions weighted by powers of central $L$-values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18469)
*Zhining Wei,Liyang Yang,Shifan Zhao*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了给定一组原始希尔伯特模形式，并对低权重的L函数的L级数和随机矩阵理论进行了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过权重为L函数值的平方根的分布来理解迪厄多内猜想的背景，这可能对理解等分布和L函数的性质有重要影响。

Method: 论文调查了低权重的L函数的分布，其中包括利用随机矩阵理论和技术来描述所选模形式下的权重分布。

Result: 对于r=1,2,3时的分布W_r结果符合随机矩阵理论的预测，并提出了关于W_r的明确猜想公式。

Conclusion: 结果与预测非常吻合，留下了对更广情况下W_r结构的进一步研究空间。

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(\textbf{k},\mathfrak{q})$ be the set of primitive Hilbert
modular forms of weight $\textbf{k}$ and prime level $\mathfrak{q}$, with
trivial central character. We study the one-level density of low-lying zeros of
$L(s,\pi)$ weighted by powers of central $L$-values $L(1/2,\pi)^r$, where $\pi$
runs through $\mathcal{F}(\textbf{k},\mathfrak{q})$. For $r=1,2,3$, we show
that the resulting distributions $W_r$ match with predictions from Random
Matrix Theory. For general $r \geq 1$, we also formulate a conjectural formula
for $W_r$ based on the ``recipe'' method.

### [11] [The complexity of Ford domains of $Γ_0(N)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18511)
*Pengcheng Zhang*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 这篇文章定义了一个关于每个大于1的整数N的 Ford 基本域形状的复杂度指标c(N)，并给出c(N)=0时N的完整分类以及当N的不同质因数个数和最小质因数都趋于无穷时c(N)趋于无穷的证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂度指标c(N)最初作为Anke Pohl一篇论文中的技术假设出现，与Don Zagier关于Γ_0(N)‘约化理论’的猜想密切相关。因此，研究c(N)的性质及其分类对于验证Zagier的猜想具有重要意义。

Method: 作者首先定义了复杂度c(N)，然后结合Ford基本域和Γ_0(N)的结构进行分析，通过研究N的质因数情况得出分类结果。最后，利用质因数数量和最小质因数增长性的分析方法证明了c(N)趋于无穷的结论。

Result: 给出了所有使c(N)=0的整数N>1的完整分类，并证明了当N的质因数个数和最小质因数都趋于无穷时，复杂度c(N)也趋于无穷。

Conclusion: 研究结果为Zagier关于Γ_0(N)约化理论的猜想提供了支持，证明了c(N)=0的分类完整性以及c(N)的极限行为。

Abstract: For each integer $N>1$, we define a notion of complexity $c(N)$, which is a
nonnegative integer and carries some information on the shape of the Ford
fundamental domain of the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_0(N)$. The property that
$c(N)=0$ first appeared as a technical assumption in a paper by Anke Pohl,
which is closely related to a conjecture of Don Zagier on the "reduction
theory" of $\Gamma_0(N)$. In this paper, we give a complete classification of
integers $N>1$ with $c(N)=0$, and we also show that $c(N)$ goes to infinity if
both the number of distinct prime factors of $N$ and the smallest prime factor
of $N$ go to infinity.

### [12] [Principal Well-Rounded Ideals of real quadratic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18518)
*Morgan Smith,Ha T. N. Tran*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 该论文研究实二次域中的主理想（PWR理想）存在的必要且充分条件，提出判断条件和构造算法，并分析质PWR理想的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在解决实二次域中PWR理想存在的判定问题，并利用算法快速构造这些理想。

Method: 作者结合高斯关于主理想等价的结论与Srinivasan的条件，推导出判定准则；设计亚指数时间算法并采用概率方法进行平方因子检测以提升实率。

Result: 证明了存在无限多个具有PWR理想的实二次域，且这些理想两两不相似；提出了高效算法，并研究了质PWR理想的存在性。

Conclusion: 论文得出实二次域中PWR理想存在性的全面结果，并为生成这些理想提供了理论与实用相结合的算法。

Abstract: It has been well known since Gauss that the principality of an ideal in a
real quadratic field $K$ is equivalent to the solvability of a certain
generalized Pell equations. In this paper, we combine this classical result
with Srinivasan's conditions for the existence of well-rounded ideals in $K$ to
obtain necessary and sufficient criteria for a real quadratic field to have
principal well-rounded (PWR) ideals. Using these criteria, we prove that there
are infinitely many real quadratic fields that have PWR ideals. Moreover, these
ideals are pairwise non-similar. We then construct new algorithms that produce
these PWR ideals, especially when the field discriminant is large. Our
algorithms run in sub-exponential time theoretically; however, they are very
fast in practice by employing some commonly used probabilistic algorithms for
testing squarefreeness. Finally, we briefly consider criteria for the existence
of prime PWR ideals and show that there are infinitely many real quadratic
fields that have prime PWR ideals.

TL;DR: The study explores Diophantine tuples in finite fields and improves upon previous results by leveraging Shparlinski's method to achieve power-saving outcomes in quantifying these tuples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending traditional Diophantine problems to finite fields bridges classical number theory with modern cryptographic applications, enhancing our understanding of integer solutions under modular constraints.

Method: The paper employs Shparlinski's method, a technique that introduces analytical approaches to derive savings results in counting Diophantine tuples within finite field settings.

Result: It establishes power-saving results regarding the number of generalized Diophantine tuples in finite fields, surpassing prior limitations in precision and generality.

Conclusion: The findings advance the theoretical framework for Diophantine analysis in finite fields, offering improved bounds utilizable in cryptographic contexts where such mathematical principles play a critical role.

Abstract: This paper investigates a generalized version of Diophantine tuples in finite
fields. Applying Shparlinski's method, we obtain power-saving results on the

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an algorithm to determine the Galois group of an irreducible monic
polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree at most five. Following work of
Conrad, Dummit, and Stauduhar this comes down to answering two questions: Is a
given integer a square? and Does a given polynomial have an integral root?
Since these are both easily addressed with a calculator, our algorithm amounts
to Galois theory by calculator. For example, we have an implementation at
Desmos.com. In an appendix we present a simplified version of our algorithm,
suitable for a handheld calculator, in case $f(x) = x^n + px + q$.

### [15] [Cancellation in Sums of Hecke Eigenvalues Over Quadratic Polynomials and Mass Equidistribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18666)
*Steven Creech*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes cancellation in sums of Hecke eigenvalues over irreducible quadratic polynomials, providing square root cancellation results when averaged over Hecke forms in a specific weight range. A crucial contribution is a bound on Kloosterman sums which links to the mass equidistribution conjecture, showing that almost all forms satisfy it with an effective rate of convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding cancellation phenomena in sums involving Hecke eigenvalues, particularly in the context of irreducible quadratic polynomials over short intervals. This contributes to the broader fields of analytic number theory and the study of modular forms.

Method: The method involves bounding sums of Kloosterman sums over irreducible quadratic polynomials and then applying work by Nelson to relate these sums to the mass equidistribution conjecture for modular forms on compact arithmetic surfaces.

Result: The main result is that with an average over Hecke forms of weight $k$ within the range $	heta$ between $1/3$ and $1$, the sums achieve square root cancellation. Additionally, the paper contributes to the mass equidistribution conjecture by demonstrating that almost all forms satisfy it and provides an effective convergence rate of $k^{-\delta}$ for $\delta<1/2$.  Also, a secondary outcome is giving an effective convergence rate for the equidistribution of sup norms of Hecke-Maass forms for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over weight $k$ family.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates square root cancellation for the specified sums and advances the understanding of the mass equidistribution conjecture by establishing its validity for almost all forms. The effective convergence rate provided adds significant value for further research in the analytical properties of Hecke eigenvalues and modular forms.

Abstract: We study cancellation in sums of Hecke eigenvalues over irreducible quadratic
polynomials over short intervals. In particular, we look at an average over
bases of Hecke forms of weight $k$ in the range $\vert k-K\vert<K^\theta$ where
$1/3<\theta<1$. We see that when averaged over this family such sums admit
square root cancellation. The key new arithmetic input for such a result is a
bound on sums of Kloosterman sums over irreducible quadratic polynomials. Then
using work of Nelson, we relate such sums to the mass equidistribution
conjecture for modular forms on compact arithmetic surfaces, and we show that
almost all forms satisfy the mass equidistribution conjecture. Furthermore,
such forms will satisfy the conjecture with an effective convergence rate of
$k^{-\delta}$ for any $\delta<1/2$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 95 years ago Hoheisel proved the existence of primes in the sub-linear
interval \[ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 33000}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$
sufficiently large}. \] This was improved by Heilbronn, proving existence of
primes in the interval \[ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 250}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for
$x$ sufficiently large}. \] More recently Baker, Harman, Pintz proved existence
of primes in the interval \[ \left[x, x+ x^{1-{19\over 40}}\right] \qquad
\hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. \] In the present article I will, to the
extent possible, make some of these statements effective. Specifically, among
other things, I shall show that \[ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq
\exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+
x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; \] \[ \forall n \geq 156, \qquad\forall x \geq
[155^{155}]^{n/(n-155)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval}
\left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. \] Furthermore \[ \forall n \geq 185,
\qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x,
x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. \] In particular this last observation makes both
the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective. This
(relatively) specific observation can be extended and generalized in various
manners.

Motivation: 研究单本(strictly-Perron)多项式的存在性，特别是在度数n≥2时的无限性，扩展了佩龙数理论及其在代数数论中的应用，尤其是单本(单根生成)环的探讨。

Method: 作者采用构造性与非构造性相结合的方法，例如通过代数数的整数环基底理论，及佩龙数、反佩龙数、塞勒姆数的排除条件进行证明。

Result: 作者证明了当n≥2时，存在无限多的单本(strictly-Perron)多项式，这些多项式不可约于Q且其生成的环的整数基底为{1,θ,θ²,...,θ^{n-1}}。

Conclusion: 这一结论深化了对佩龙数及其代数构造的理解，提示了单本环的普遍性，并支持在代数数论中进一步探索其结构性质。

Abstract: A monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ is called monogenic
if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots
,\theta^{n-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$,
where $f(\theta)=0$. A strictly-Perron polynomial is the minimal polynomial of
a Perron number $\lambda$ such that $\lambda$ is neither a Pisot number, an
anti-Pisot number, nor a Salem number. For any natural number $n\ge 2$, we
prove that there exist infinitely many monogenic strictly-Perron polynomials of
degree $n$.

Conclusion: 本文成功证明了交集多项式在高斯整数背景下的密度性质，并通过结合已有证明方法，拓展了这一领域在纯数学组合分析中的理论基础，特别是对高斯整数上差值的刻画具有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of intersective polynomials over the Gaussian
integers, and prove that given any intersective polynomial $p(x)$ over the
Gaussian integers, every subset $A$ of the Gaussian integers of positive upper
density contains two distinct elements such that their difference is $p(z)$ for
some Gaussian integer $z$. Moreover, we also obtain a quantitative version of
this result. The proof is motivated by an argument due to Lucier, and the
Fourier-free proof of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over the
integers by Green, Tao and Ziegler.

*Chi Wa Chan,Antigona Pajaziti,Flavio Perissinotto,Antonella Perucca*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper provides a complete understanding of entanglement of radicals, demonstrating that additive relations among radicals over any field are extremely scarce. This work resolves a well-known theorem by Kneser (1975) regarding the linear independence of radicals and solves a problem posed by Lenstra (2006).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand and quantify the number of additive relations among radicals over arbitrary fields, which has been a topic of interest for mathematicians since at least 1975 with Kneser's theorem and continued into 2006 with Lenstra's problem.

Method: The authors achieve a full understanding by generalizing and extending previous theorems on the linear independence of radicals, likely involving advanced algebraic techniques.

Result: The paper establishes that there are extremely few field relations among distinct radicals over any field, effectively solving Kneser's theorem and Lenstra's problem.

Conclusion: This work completes and strengthens prior understanding of the entanglement of radicals, providing a comprehensive resolution to a long-standing mathematical question.

Abstract: In this work we achieve a full understanding of the so-called entanglement of
radicals, showing that over any field there are extremely few additive
relations among radicals. Our results complete a famous theorem by Kneser from
1975 on the linear independence of radicals and solve a problem discussed by
Lenstra in 2006.

### [21] [Duality for arithmetic Dijkgraaf-Witten theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19214)
*Jaro Eichler*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper extends Naidu's classification of finite group pairs and 3-cocycles for Dijkgraaf-Witten theory from 3-manifolds to arithmetic contexts over specific number fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extension of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory to arithmetic settings, particularly over totally imaginary number fields, is of interest to explore deeper connections between topology and number theory, and to generalize known equivalences in 3-manifold theories.

Method: The authors analyze arithmetic analogs of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, focusing on totally imaginary number fields F with n-th roots of unity and using X as a subset of the spectrum of the ring of integers O_F. They provide examples and derive sufficient conditions for equivalence.

Result: The paper provides examples where the expected equivalences fail when considering the full ring of integers in quadratic fields and the quaternion group Q_8, and identifies situations under which these equivalences remain valid.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of arithmetic Dijkgraaf-Witten theories by establishing when equivalences similar to Naidu's classification hold or fail, thereby bridging concepts from topology and number theory.

Abstract: Naidu classified pairs of finite groups and 3-cocycles that lead to
equivalent Dijkgraaf-Witten theories for 3-manifolds. We establish analogous
equivalences for arithmetic Dijkgraaf-Witten theory over totally imaginary
number fields F containing n-th roots of unity, where n is invertible on X
subset spec O_F. For the full ring of integers X = spec O_F, we give examples
with quadratic fields and the quaternion group Q_8 where these equivalences
fail, but also identify sufficient conditions under which they still hold.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that a faithful projective-injective module over a finite-dimensional
algebra $A$ has the double centraliser property if and only if $A$ as a
bimodule is reflexive. More generally, we provide a new characterisation of the
classical dominant dimension by showing that having dominant dimension at least
$n$ is equivalent to the bimodule $A$ being $n$-torsion-free. This allows us to
find new connections between the classical Tachikawa and Nakayama conjectures
and Gorenstein homological algebra. Furthermore, we use our results to give new
interpretations of Hochschild (co)homology of finite-dimensional algebras using
higher Auslander-Reiten translates and the canonical bimodule in the sense of
Fang, Kerner and Yamagata.

### [23] [On angular momentum algebras and their relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18454)
*Kieran Calvert,Marcelo De Martino,Roy Oste*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: In this paper, we study the centraliser of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$, the total angular momentum algebra (TAMA), in the Weyl-Clifford algebra. We define the TAMA as an extension of the the angular momentum algebra (AMA), considered as the centraliser of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$. The relation of the angular momentum algebra described by Feigin and Hakobyan is used to construct an analogous relation in the even subalgebra of the TAMA. We prove that, for rank 4 and 5, these relations yield a presentation for the even subalgebra of the TAMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of centralisers of Lie superalgebras in Weyl-Clifford algebras is an important field in mathematical physics and representation theory. The motivation of this paper arises from the previous established relation for the angular momentum algebra (AMA), which the total angular momentum algebra (TAMA) extends. It is aiming to generalise the crossing relation from AMA to TAMA in order to understand the structural properties and the representation of TAMA in the Weyl-Clifford algebra context.

Method: The method involves using Young symmetrisers to construct an analogous relation to the one defined by Feigin and Hakobyan for the AMA in the context of the even subalgebra of TAMA. We then verify this claim by proving that the constructed relations indeed form a presentation for the even subalgebra of TAMA in the case of ranks 4 and 5, ensuring the relations are correct and sufficient for the model of the algebra.

Result: The main result of the paper is the construction of a presentation for the even subalgebra of the TAMA (centraliser of $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ in the Weyl-Clifford algebra) for rank 4 and 5 using relationships analogous to the AMA, which is the centraliser of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$. The outcomes confirm that these relations form a valid presentation for the algebra, extending earlier results in the field and providing a foundation for further investigations into the structure of TAMA.

Conclusion: The paper significantly contributes to the understanding of the representation theory of Lie superalgebras by establishing a diagrammatic presentation for the even subalgebra of the TAMA for ranks 4 and 5. This analogy with the AMA's crossing relation enables effective structural analysis and potentially opens new avenues for research in theoretical physics and mathematics, particularly in the context of Lie superalgebras.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the centraliser of $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$, denoted the
total angular momentum algebra (TAMA), in the Weyl Clifford algebra. The TAMA
extends the angular momentum algebra (AMA), which arises as the centraliser of
$\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and admits a diagrammatic presentation via the crossing
relation described by Feigin and Hakobyan. Using Young symmetrisers we
construct an analogue relation for the even subalgebra of the TAMA. We prove
that for rank $4$ and $5$ these relations generate a presentation for the even
subalgebra of the TAMA.

Motivation: 在这项工作中，研究者试图通过对例外序列和倾斜模的几何实现，提供加权射影直线上的coherent sheaf范畴的组合描述。

Method: 作者通过标记环面来描述coherent sheaf范畴中的态射，这是一种几何方法来实现例外序列，接着使用格点路径来描述倾斜模，并计算范畴中的tilting sheaves数量（适当考虑Auslander-Reiten平移）。

Result: 论文展示了如何分类完整例外序列、如何有效扩展例外序列，以及辫群在完整例外序列上的作用的传递性的一个新证明。此外，作者提供了一种关于tilting bundles的组合描述，并进行了tilting sheaves数量的计数。

Conclusion: 本论文为加权射影直线上的coherent sheaf范畴提供了有价值的组合与几何描述，从而推动了例外序列和tilting sheaves的研究。

Abstract: We provide a combinatorial description of morphisms in the coherent sheaf
category ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$ over weighted projective line of
type $(p,q)$ via a marked annulus. This leads to a geometric realization of
exceptional sequences in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$. As applications,
we present a classification of complete exceptional sequences, an effective
method for enlarging exceptional sequences, and a new proof of the transitivity
of the braid group action on complete exceptional sequences. Besides, we offer
a combinatorial description of tilting bundles via lattice paths and count the
number of tilting sheaves in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$, up to the
Auslander-Reiten translation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $g$-fan $\Sigma(A)$ of a finite dimensional algebra $A$ is a non-singular
fan in its real Grothendieck group, defined by tilting theory. If the union
${\rm P}(A)$ of the simplices associated with the cones of $\Sigma(A)$ is
convex, we call $A$ $g$-convex. In this case, the $g$-polytope ${\rm P}(A)$ of
$A$ is a reflexive polytope. Thus, in each dimension, there are only finitely
many isomorphism classes of fans that can be realized as $g$-fans of $g$-convex
algebras. An important problem is to classify such fans for a fixed dimension
$d$. In this paper, we give a complete answer for the case $d=3$: we prove that
there are precisely 61 convex $g$-fans of dimension 3 up to isomorphism. Our
method is based on the decomposition of fans into the $2^3$ orthants in the
real Grothendieck group of $A$, together with a detailed analysis of possible
sequences of $g$-vectors arising from iterated mutations.

*Ekaterina Bogdanova*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper proves that cuspidal automorphic twisted D-modules for reductive groups of adjoint type have non-vanishing quantum Whittaker coefficients and provides their microlocal interpretation with some hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to deepen the understanding of automorphic forms and their representations by exploring the properties of quantum Whittaker coefficients in the context of twisted D-modules.

Method: The method involves advanced techniques in representation theory and algebraic geometry, particularly focusing on the singular support and the use of microlocal analysis to interpret quantum Whittaker coefficients for any $\check{\Lambda}^+$-valued divisor. This approach allows the authors to connect the algebraic structures with geometric insights.

Result: The key result is the proof that cuspidal automorphic twisted D-modules for reductive groups of adjoint type have non-vanishing quantum Whittaker coefficients, and the development of a microlocal interpretation for these coefficients under specific conditions related to singular support.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by establishing a significant link between the non-vanishing property of quantum Whittaker coefficients and the structure of cuspidal automorphic twisted D-modules, contributing to the broader field of automorphic representations and their geometric interpretations.

Abstract: We prove that for any reductive group $G$ of adjoint type cuspidal
automorphic twisted D-modules have non-vanishing quantum Whittaker
coefficients. The argument provides a microlocal interpretation of quantum
Whittaker coefficients for any $\check{\Lambda}^+$-valued divisor under some
hypothesis on singular support.

### [28] [An introduction to $(G,c)$-bands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19066)
*Luca Francone,Bernard Leclerc*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cluster structure framework for $(G,c)$-bands, constructs a discrete difference Miura transformation from the loop group $LG$, and verifies the Frenkel-Reshetikhin conjecture on using this transformation to calculate the $q$-characters in quantum affine algebra finite-dimensional representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on the work of Frenkel and Reshetikhin to develop and apply cluster structures, underlining the significance of these mathematical structures in understanding and extending previous theories related to the quantum affine algebra and its representations.

Method: Using $(G,c)$-bands as the foundation, the paper constructs a discrete version of the difference Miura transformation in the context of the loop group $LG$. This transformation is then applied to calculate the $q$-characters for Frenkel-Reshetikhin conjecture's finite-dimensional quantum affine algebra $U_q(	widehat{	mathfrak{g}})$ representations.

Result: The paper verifies the Frenkel-Reshetikhin conjecture through a discrete analogous approach using $(G,c)$-bands, establishing the construction of the difference Miura transformation and the calculation of $q$-characters for quantum affine algebra representations of type $A$, $D$, and $E$. This leads to a deeper understanding in the field of quantum groups and their applications.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and validity of using $(G,c)$-bands to form a discrete difference transformation and validate the conjecture, showcasing how cluster structures can be instrumental in bridging concepts from loop groups to quantum affine algebras and amplifying the original contributions by Frenkel and Reshetikhin.

Abstract: We give an introduction to our results on cluster structures for schemes of
$(G,c)$-bands emphasizing their connections with seminal works of Frenkel and
Reshetikhin in the 90's. In particular we construct using $(G,c)$-bands a
discrete analogue of the difference Miura transformation of the loop group
$LG$, and we show that it calculates the $q$-characters of the
finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ of the same $A$, $D$, $E$ type as $G$, thus
verifying a conjecture of Frenkel and Reshetikhin.
