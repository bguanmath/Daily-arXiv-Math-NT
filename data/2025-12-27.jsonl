Moreover, the injectivity of the Kudla-Millson theta lift is demonstrated in the O$(n,2)$ case in greater generality than is currently available in the literature. Both results are derived under the assumption of a single hyperbolic split of the base lattice."}

For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$."}

While explicit moduli descriptions of X_1(N) are well developed, a comparable construction for X_0(N) has remained incomplete. We give a uniform method for constructing explicit generators of C(X_0(N)), extending an approach of Dowd, and use them to obtain a concrete moduli interpretation of cyclic N-isogenies. This yields explicit formulas for sporadic rational points on X_0(N) and the associated isogenies, providing a unified solution to the moduli problem for X_0(N)."}

Many examples of such infinite series are shown, including $1-2+2^3-2^6+\\cdots$, which is in Entry 7 of Gauss's diary and its value $0.4275251302\\cdots$ is here obtained."}

We also present the relations between the $C$-matrices, the $G$-matrices, and the $F$-polynomials of a generalized cluster pattern and those of the corresponding composite cluster pattern."}

Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case."}
