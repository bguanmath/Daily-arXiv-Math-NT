Abstract: In \cite{FT19}, Finkelberg and Tsymbaliuk introduced the notion of shifted
quantum affine algebras and described their role in the study of quantized
Coulomb branches associated to certain 3D $N = 4$ quiver gauge theories. We
describe a new geometric construction of a deformation of one of these shifted
quantum affine algebras as the Hall algebra of the category of representations
of a certain quiver $Q_{\textrm{Rud}}$ (modulo relations). This quiver first
arose in the work of Rudakov in the study of the tame blocks of the category of
restricted representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Inspired by orbit parametrizations in arithmetic statistics, we explain how
to construct families of curves associated to certain nilpotent elements in
$\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras, generalizing work of Thorne to
the $m\geq 3$ case and the non-simply laced case. We classify such families
arising from subregular nilpotents in stable gradings and interpret almost all
orbit parametrizations associated with algebraic curves appearing in the
literature in this framework. As an extended example, we give a Lie-theoretic
proof of the integral orbit parametrization of $5$-Selmer elements of elliptic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, using a $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$-grading on a Lie
algebra of type $E_8$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we study real numbers $x$ for which $p(x)$ is (absolutely)
normal for every non-constant integer-valued polynomial $p$. We call such
numbers transcendentally normal. We prove that almost every real number is
transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number,
based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called
stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an
algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all
integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and
compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by
the law of the iterated logarithm. We also take the opportunity to discuss
several interesting open problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study rational points on the elliptic surface given by the equation:
  $$y^2 = x^3 + AxQ(u,v)^2 + BQ(u,v)^3,$$
  where $A,B\in \mathbb{Z}$ satisfy that $4A^3-27B^2\neq 0$ and $Q(u,v)$ is a
positive-definite quadratic form. We prove asymptotics for a special subset of
the rational points, specifically those that are integral with respect to the
singularity. This method utilizes Mordell's parameterization of integral points
on quadratic twists on elliptic curves, which is based on a syzygy for
invariants of binary quartic forms.
  Let $F(A,B)$ denote the set of binary quartic forms with invariants $-4A$ and
$-4B$ under the action of $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We reduce the
point-counting problem to the question of determining an asymptotic formula for
the correlation sums of representation numbers of binary quadratic and binary
quartic forms, where the quartic forms range in $F(A,B)$. These sums are then
treated using a connection to modular forms.
  In a stand-alone appendix, we study sums of absolute values of Hecke
eigenvalues of $\textrm{GL}(2)$ representations that are tempered at all finite
places. We show that these sums exhibit logarithmic savings over the trivial
bound if and only if the representation is cuspidal. Further, we connect the
problem of studying the sums of Hecke eigenvalues along polynomial values to
the base change problem for $\textrm{GL}(2).$

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Chebotarev's density theorem asserts that the prime ideals are
equidistributed among the conjugacy classes of the Galois group of any normal
extension of number fields. An effective version of this theorem was first
established by Lagarias and Odlyzko in 1977. In this article, we present an
explicit refinement of their statement that applies to all non-rational fields,
with every implicit constant expressed explicitly in terms of the field
invariants. Additionally, we provide a sharper bound for extensions of
sufficiently small degree. Our approach begins by proving an explicit formula
for a smoothed prime ideal counting function. This relies on recent zero-free
regions for Dedekind zeta functions, improved estimates on the number of
low-lying zeros, and precise bounds for sums over the non-trivial zeros of the
Dedekind $\zeta$-function.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We recast congruences for the partition function through the geometry of
supersingular elliptic curves. For primes $\ell\ge5$ inert in
$K_n=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1-24n})$ (equivalently
$\big(\tfrac{1-24n}{\ell}\big)=-1$), we show that $p(n)\pmod{\ell}$ is a
"supersingular trace'' on $X_0(6)$: a computable dot product on the level-$6$
Brandt module that is a twisted analogue of the Deuring--Eichler formula for
class numbers. In the ramified case $\ell\in\{5,7,11\}$ (i.e.
$\ell\mid(1-24n)$), a geometric "bonus valuation'' along supersingular fibers
forces Ramanujan's congruences \[ p(5n+4)\equiv0\pmod5,\qquad
p(7n+5)\equiv0\pmod7,\qquad p(11n+6)\equiv0\pmod{11}. \] This phenomenon occurs
because the supersingular $j$-invariants on $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$ for
these primes lie over $\{0,1728\}$, allowing a certain Serre-Tate pullback to
be regular at every supersingular point.

### [8] [An algorithm for the Product-Sum Equality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09647)
*Hlib Husarov,Eberhard Mayerhofer*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a recursive algorithm to identify all finite sequences of positive integers where the product of the sequence equals the sum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of identifying sequences that satisfy the condition where the product of their elements is equal to the sum of the elements is of interest in number theory. These sequences have mathematical properties worth exploring and understanding for theoretical applications.

Method: The method involves a recursive approach that builds upon solutions of strictly shorter length. It iteratively extends shorter valid sequences in an attempt to find sequences of a given length that meet the condition of product equalling sum.

Result: The paper presents an efficient recursive algorithm capable of solving the posed problem effectively. Its time complexity is favorable, comparable to that of quick sort algorithm.

Conclusion: This recursive algorithm offers a systematic and efficient method to solve the problem of finding finite sequences where the product equals the sum, contributing to the understanding of such mathematical structures.

Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for identifying all finite sequences of
positive integers whose product equals their sum. Our method uses solutions of
strictly shorter length that are iteratively extended in pursuit of a valid
solution. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity similar to the
quick sort algorithm.

### [9] [Congruences modulo powers of $7$ for $k$-elongated plane partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09723)
*Dandan Chen,Tianjian Xu,Siyu Yin*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper shows an infinite family of congruences for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7, extending previous results by Banerjee and Smoot on $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The k-elongated plane partition diamonds generalize integer partitions, and studying their congruences helps understand arithmetic properties of partition functions. Previous work established congruences modulo 5 for $d_5(n)$, but the case modulo 7 was unexplored for these diamonds.

Method: The authors used modular forms and elementary number theory techniques to prove the existence of an infinite family of congruences for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.

Result: New infinite congruence families for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo 7, 49, etc., were found, extending the results of Banerjee and Smoot.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the richness of congruence structures for k-elongated plane partition diamonds modulo 7, suggesting further generalizations or similar results for other primes.

Abstract: The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has
emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$.
Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via
elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and
Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers
of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for
$d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.

### [10] [Congruences of $p$-adic $L$-functions of modular forms at non-ordinary primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09733)
*Raiza Corpuz,Antonio Lei*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文研究了 $p$-非普通尖点征形式的同余关系，证明了其Iwasawa不变量满足显式公式，并建立了两者间的主猜想等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究基于Greenberg-Vatsal与Emerton-Pollack-Weston的结果，旨在推广到 $p$-non-ordinary 的情况下，探讨等权重的 $p$-congruent 尖点征形式 $f$ 和 $g$ 在 $p$-进数 $L$-函数上的同余。

Method: 通过比较 $p$-adic $L$-functions 的 $Iwasawa$ 不变量来证明显式公式，并使用相同的假设条件下分析 $\mu$-不变量的消失情况，从而推导主猜想的等价性。

Result: 得出 $f$ 和 $g$ 的Iwasawa不变量在适当条件下满足显式公式，并且当 $\mu$-不变量消失时，$f$ 满足的主猜想与 $g$ 满足的主猜想是等价的。

Conclusion: 结果为研究非普通情况下的 $p$-进数 $L$-函数提供了新的方法，并推动了Iwasawa理论的发展。

Abstract: We present an analogue of Greenberg-Vatsal's and Emerton-Pollack-Weston's
results on congruences of $p$-adic $L$-functions for $p$-non-ordinary cuspidal
eigenforms $f$ and $g$ of equal weight that are $p$-congruent. In particular,
we prove that the Iwasawa invariants of the analytic and algebraic signed
$p$-adic $L$-functions of $f$ and $g$ are related by explicit formulae under
appropriate hypotheses. We also show under the same assumptions that provided
the algebraic and analytic $\mu$-invariants vanish, the signed Iwasawa main
conjecture is true for $f$ if and only if it is true for $g$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote
the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different
nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets}
associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where
self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication
method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more
flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale
computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many
such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems
about these new regions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\chi$ be an idele class character over a number field $F$, and let
$\pi,\pi'$ be any two cuspidal automorphic representations of
$\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. We prove that the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function
$L(s,\mathrm{Sym}^2(\pi)\times(\mathrm{Sym}^2 (\pi')\otimes\chi))$ has a
"standard" zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero except
possibly when it is divisible by the $L$-function of a real idele class
character. In particular, no such zero exists if $\pi$ is non-dihedral and
$\pi'$ is not a twist of $\pi$. Until now, this was only known when $\pi=\pi'$,
$\pi$ is self-dual, and $\chi$ is trivial.
