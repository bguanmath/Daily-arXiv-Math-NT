For $α>1/2$, we say that an odd prime $p$ is partially regular if the eigenspaces of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $\\operatorname{Cl}(K_p)$ under the Galois action vanish for all characters $ω^{p-2k}$ with \\[ 2\\le 2k \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{p}}{(\\log p)^α}. \\] Equivalently, $p\\nmid \\operatorname{num}(B_{2k})$ throughout this range. We prove that a density-one subset of primes is partially regular in this sense. By Leopoldt reflection, this yields a partial Vandiver Theorem: for a density-one set of primes $p$, the even eigenspaces $A_p(ω^{2k})$ vanish for all even $2k$ satisfying the inequality above. This result has consequences for Kubota-Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-functions, congruences between cusp forms and Eisenstein series, and $p$-torsion in algebraic $K$-groups. The theorem proving partial regularity for almost all $p$ is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture."}

Since then a lot of homological, structural and categorical properties of quasi-hereditary algebras have been discovered. This class of algebras seems quite common and occurs in many branches of mathematics. There are lots of important works on the subject. In this note we mainly survey some of Claus Michael Ringel's works or works jointly with his collaborators on quasi-hereditary algebras. Also, some of related works and recent developments on quasi-hereditary algebras are mentioned."}

Some properties of the Taylor coefficients of the lower incomplete gamma function at infinity seem to be new. Specifically, these coefficients can be expressed in terms of Touchard polynomials. Furthermore, these same coefficients can be used to reformulate the functional equation for Dirichlet $L$-functions. This relationship \"explains\"' why $\\vert L_χ(1/2+i t)\\vert $ should be small. To present the new ideas in a nutshell, we start by giving (in Section 1) a \"formula proof\" of the Lindelöf hypothesis. This is not a genuine proof, as we are not concerned with the convergence of our series nor do we justify changing the order of summation. In Section 2, we suggest some hypothetical ways of transforming the \"proof\" from Section 1 into a rigorous mathematical proof.
