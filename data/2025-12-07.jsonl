Briefly stated, an $\\mathcal{S}$-perfect number is an integer equal to a weighted sum of its proper divisors, where the weights are drawn from some fixed set $\\mathcal{S}$ of integers. After a short exposition of the definitions and some basic results, we present our preliminary investigations into the $\\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers for various special sets $\\mathcal{S}$ of small cardinality. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many $\\{0, m\\}$-perfect numbers and $\\{-1,m\\}$-perfect numbers for every $m \\geq 1$. We also provide a characterization of the $\\{-1,m\\}$-perfect numbers of the form $2^kp$ ($k \\geq 1$, $p$ an odd prime), as well as a characterization of all even $\\{-1, 1\\}$-perfect numbers."}

The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum."}

One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \\rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus.

Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is\n  similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$."}
