### [1] [On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153)

Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer
$x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$
for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps
$x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In
particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$.
This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the
conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any
correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend
their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic
integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that
correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power
series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon
F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$
otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some
of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive
integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that
$T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the
orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two
fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these
conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by
replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic
integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could
settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for
both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.

### [2] [Local-global compatibility and the exceptional zero conjecture for GL(3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10225)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove the exceptional zero conjecture of Greenberg--Benois for
$p$-ordinary regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of
$\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A})$ which are Steinberg at $p$. In particular, we
obtain the first cases of this conjecture for non-essentially-self-dual RACARs
of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A})$.
  Our proof has two main parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to
prove an exceptional zero formula using Gehrmann's automorphic
$\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove the equality of automorphic and
Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants. As one of the key ingredients for
this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois
representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$,
confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$
following the strategy in the "10-author paper," and use the $n=3$ case to
deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.

### [3] [Supercharacters of finite abelian groups and applications to spectra of $U$-unitary Cayley graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10348)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We define super-Cayley graphs over a finite abelian group $G$. Using the
theory of supercharacters on $G$, we explain how their spectra can be realized
as a super-Fourier transform of a superclass characteristic function.
Consequently, we show that a super-Cayley graph is determined by its spectrum
once an indexing on the underlying group $G$ is fixed. This generalizes a
theorem by Sander-Sander, which investigates the case where $G$ is a cyclic
group. We then use our theory to define and study the concept of a $U$-unitary
Cayley graph over a finite commutative ring $R$, where $U$ is a subgroup of the
unit group of $R$. Furthermore, when the underlying ring is a Frobenius ring,
we show that there is a natural supercharacter theory associated with $U$. By
applying the general theory of super-Cayley graphs developed in the first part,
we explore various spectral properties of these $U$-unitary Cayley graphs,
including their rationality and connections to various arithmetical sums.

TL;DR: This paper uses a combination of analytic methods and the Riemann Roch and Weil theorems to count w coprime S integers and S integral ideals in algebraic function fields over finite fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the distribution and properties of w coprime S integers and S integral ideals in algebraic function fields over finite fields is important for number theory and coding theory.

Method: The authors combined analytic methods with the Riemann Roch theorem and the Weil theorem specific to function fields in positive characteristic to achieve their results.

Result: The paper provides a method to count w coprime S integers and S integral ideals, leveraging the properties of finite fields and the theorems of Riemann Roch and Weil.

Conclusion: The approach combining analytic techniques with the Riemann Roch and Weil theorems effectively addresses the problem of counting specific types of integers and ideals in the given function fields.

Abstract: Let Fq be the finite field with q elements, and K an algebraic function field
over with Fq as its field of constants. Let S be a finite nonempty set of prime
divisors over K, and OS be the ring of integers of K attached to S. Let w
greater than 1 be an integer. In this work we shall count w coprime S integers
and S integral ideals, and our proofs are a combination of analytic methods and
the Riemann Roch theorem and the Weil theorem for function fields in positive
characteristic.

Abstract: In 2024, M. K. Ram proved that the class number of an imaginary cyclic

cyclic number fields of $2$-power degrees and not necessarily prime class
numbers.

Hasse norm principle holds for adequate extensions of prime squared degree.

### [8] [A Canonical Bijection Between Finite-Decimal Real Numbers and Natural Numbers with Constant-Time Enumeration Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10750)

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用系统化的4元组参数化方法和闭合形式的数学公式，在常数时间内建立有限十进制实数与自然数之间的双射，从而完成所有有限十进制表示实数的完全索引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在展示如何高效且精确地实现有限十进制实数和自然数之间的双射，通过避免循环枚举来提高计算效率。

Method: 作者采用了一个参数化4元组（符号，N₁, N₂, N₃）和闭合形式的数学公式来建立映射关系，并通过精确的小数运算确保准确性和避免循环。

Result: 实现了一个能在O(1)时间内运行的枚举系统，精确处理所有有限十进制表示的实数，并通过这种方式证明有限十进制实数可以与自然数完全对应。

Conclusion: 该系统表明，有限十进制实数可以通过这种4元组参数化方法实现系统性的枚举和索引。

Abstract: We present an explicit bijection between finite-decimal real numbers and
natural numbers ($\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$) using a systematic 4-tuple
parametrization with closed-form mathematical formulas for enumeration. Our
enumeration system provides complete indexing of all real numbers with
terminating decimal representations through the parametrization $(\text{sign},
N_1, N_2, N_3)$. Both forward and inverse mappings execute in O(1) constant
time, achieved through closed-form lexicographic positioning formulas that
eliminate enumeration loops. The system uses exact decimal arithmetic
throughout, ensuring perfect accuracy across all representable numbers. This
bijective correspondence demonstrates that finite-decimal real numbers can be
systematically enumerated and indexed with optimal constant-time computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: 本方法有效分类模群等变解，结果依赖于直交多项式性质，为相关领域研究提供框架。

Abstract: We study second-order modular differential equations whose solutions
transform equivariantly under the modular group. In the reducible case, we
construct all such solutions using an explicit ansatz involving Eisenstein
series and the $J$-invariant, reducing the problem to an algebraic system. We
show that the roots of this system are captured by orthogonal polynomials
satisfying a Fuchsian differential equation. Their recurrence, norms, and
weight function are derived, completing the classification of equivariant
solutions in this setting.

### [10] [Tatuzawa's theorem for Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10844)
*Gergely Harcos,Jesse Thorner*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper extends zero-free regions for Rankin-Selberg L-functions twisted by GL(1) characters, generalizing results by other authors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the distribution of zeros of L-functions is important in number theory for applications such as analytic properties, subconvexity, and the Riemann Hypothesis. The paper aims to generalize existing zero-free regions, expanding on prior work to provide broader theoretical insights.

Method: The authors utilize methods from analytic number theory, particularly leveraging a new standard zero-free region for twists of L(s, π×π̃) by idele class characters, except for a potential real simple exceptional zero when π⊗χ²=π. This builds upon prior techniques developed by Humphries and Thorner.

Result: A new zero-free region is established for all GL(1) twists of the Rankin-Selberg L-function L(s, π×π′), generalizing Tatuzawa’s refinement of Siegel’s work. Additionally, the paper demonstrates a standard zero-free region for any idele class character twist of L(s, π×π̃) with a specified condition for an exceptional zero.

Conclusion: The results contribute to the understanding of the analytic behavior of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, particularly in the presence of GL(1) twists. These zero-free region results have implications for subconvexity estimates, prime number theorems, and may influence further research in automorphic forms and L-functions, extending prior works in the field.

Abstract: Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of
$\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ with unitary central characters. We
establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the
Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's
refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. A crucial component of
our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of
$L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a
possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur
only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and
Thorner.

### [11] [The Alternative Hypothesis for Zeros of the Riemann Zeta-Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10857)
*Siegfred Alan C. Baluyot,Daniel Alan Goldston,Ade Irma Suriajaya,Caroline L. Turnage-Butterbaugh*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文在黎曼假设和改进的备择假设下，研究了黎曼zeta函数零点间距的密度性质，得出了关于零点对和多重零点间距的新约束，并提出了一个更强度的备择假设，从而证明了其偶素性假设的推论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了进一步研究黎曼zeta函数零点的分布特性，特别是在不假设零点为单重的情况下，探索间距的限制如何影响零点对和多重零点的密度。

Method: 通过假设黎曼假设和备择假设，采用分析方法对每整数.k.推导出归一化间距为平均间距的一半的倍数时，对零点对的密度进行限制，并利用更强的备择假设形式来约束多重零点的密度。

Result: 得到了归一化间距分别是平均间距的.k.次倍数的零点对的密度限制，并且通过强化的备择假设，证明了其偶素性假设的推论。

Conclusion: 改进的备择假设给出的信息比简单形式更丰富，它不仅约束了相邻零点的间距，还暗示了偶素性假设很可能成立，为黎曼zeta函数零点的研究提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In 2016, the first-named author introduced a formulation of the Alternative
Hypothesis that assumes that consecutive zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are
spaced at multiples of half of the average spacing, but does not assume that
the zeros are simple. In this paper, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis and a
similar formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis, and for each integer $k$ we
obtain constraints on the density of pairs of zeros whose normalized
differences are at $k/2$ times the average spacing. These constraints, in turn,
restrict the density of (possible) multiple zeros. We also formulate a stronger
version of the Alternative Hypothesis and show that it implies the Essential
Simplicity Hypothesis.

addition, I give further relations and implications to two families of
polynomials related to the Alladi-Schur polynomials.

Abstract: Generalizing the theory of parity sheaves on complex algebraic stacks due to
Juteau-Mautner-Williamson, we develop a theory of twisted equivariant parity
sheaves. We use this formalism to construct a modular incarnation of Lusztig
and Yun's monodromic Hecke category. We then give two applications: (1) a
modular categorification of the monodromic Hecke algebra, and (2) a monoidal
equivalence between the monodromic Hecke category of parity sheaves and the
ordinary Hecke category of parity sheaves on the endoscopic group.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Brylinski-Kostant filtration on a representation of a finite-dimensional
semisimple Lie algebra has interpretations in terms of the algebra, geometry
and combinatorics of the representation. Its extension to affine Lie algebras
was first studied by Slofstra. Recent work of the present authors constructed a
Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt type basis for the dominant weight spaces of the
basic representation of affine Lie algebras of type $A$, which is compatible
with the affine Brylinski filtration. In this paper, we overcome the constraint
of type dependence, and furnish a new, uniform proof which holds for all
simply-laced affine Lie algebras.

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{o}_l$ be a finite principal ideal local ring of length $l$.
The degenerate Whittaker space associated with a representation of ${\rm
GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ is a representation of ${\rm GL}_n(\mathfrak{o}_l)$.
For strongly cuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ the
structure of degenerate Whittaker space is described by Prasad's conjecture,
which has been proven for ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$. In this paper, we
describe the degenerate Whittaker space for certain induced representations of
${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$, specifically those induced from subgroups
analogous to the maximal parabolic subgroups of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_q)$.

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper provides new proofs for two-parameter quantum groups using twist methods from bicharacters and extends to super and multiparameter cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to present both new elementary proofs of existing results and extend them to super and multiparameter quantum groups, thus offering a method for generalization and paving the way for further research into the properties and applications of these groups.

Method: Applying a general twist construction using skew bicharacters to one-parameter quantum groups in Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld (affine types), and FRT (finite and affine) presentations, thereby deriving two-parameter versions.

Result: Obtained two-parameter quantum groups across different presentations (Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld, FRT), leading to new elementary proofs for their fundamental properties.

Conclusion: The approach using skew bicharacters for twisting is effective and generalizes to more complex settings such as super and multiparameter cases, indicating its potential for broader applications in quantum group theory.

Abstract: We apply the general construction of a twist of bigraded Hopf algebras by
skew bicharacters to obtain two-parameter quantum groups in the Drinfeld-Jimbo,
new Drinfeld (for affine types), and FRT (for both finite and affine)
presentations from their standard one-parameter versions. This yields new
elementary proofs of the fundamental results on two-parameter quantum groups
that appeared in the literature over the last two decades, and also leads to
natural generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases.
