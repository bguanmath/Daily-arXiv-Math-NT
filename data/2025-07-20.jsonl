Unlike the classic arrow removal operation of\nGreen-Psaroudakis-Solberg, our methods allow for removing arrows even when they\noccur in every generating set for the defining admissible ideal of the algebra.\nOur first main result establishes an equivalence for the finiteness of the\nfinitistic (and global) dimensions of a ring $\\Lambda$ and its quotient\n$\\Lambda/K$, under specific homological and structural conditions on the ideal\n$K$, in the broader context of left artinian rings.

Towards the opposite\ndirection, we characterize generalized arrow removal algebras via removable\nmultiplicative bimodules, and introduce trivial one-arrow extensions as a novel\ncombinatorial construction for adding arrows while preserving the finiteness of\nthe finitistic (and global) dimensions.
