We propose some conjectures\nconcerning the simple quotients of $M\\otimes N$, where $M,N$ are objects in the\nrepresentation category $\\mathscr{X}({\\bf G})$. We provide several pieces of\nevidence for these conjectures. In particular, we show that these conjectures\nare valid for ${\\bf G}=SL_2(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$."}

This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ\npair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are\nthus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $\\Gamma_p$ by\nLong and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences\nB.2, C.2, D.2, E.2, F.2, G.2, and H.2. This approach also yields the known\nextensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo\n$4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence I.2 is shown to be a special case\nof the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds."}
