We prove a more general\nresult under weaker assumptions. The result is used to describe the action of\nthe derived Satake equivalence on !-pure objects and show that the equivalence\nenjoys a new kind of functoriality with respect to morphisms of reductive\ngroups. We find and prove normality of the symplectic dual X^! for many smooth\naffine Hamiltonian G-varieties X, including X=T^*(G/H) for all connected\nreductive subgroups H of G. We also describe the symplectic duals M^! in the\ncase of Coulomb branches and prove that M^! has symplectic singularities."}

As before, we again study here counting problems that are inspired\nby the exciting advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics\nand on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then\nfirst prove that for any given prime $p\\geq 3$ and any integer $\\ell \\geq 1$,\nthe average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any\n$\\varphi_{p^{\\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is bounded (if\n$\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\setminus \\{1,p\\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\\ell \\in\n\\{1,p\\}$) as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic\npoint-counting work of Benedetto, along with a conjecture of Hutz on\n$2$-periodic rational points of any $\\varphi_{(p-1)^{\\ell}, c}$ for any given\nprime $p\\geq 5$ and any integer $\\ell \\geq 1$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then\nalso prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of\nany $\\varphi_{(p-1)^{\\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or\n$2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity.

To do this, we develop an efficient sieving\nstrategy that makes use of a power-saving variant of the Bombieri--Vinogradov\ntheorem.
