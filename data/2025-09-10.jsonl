Motivated by the Duflo--Serganova functor in Lie superalgebras, we\nconstruct various functors of interest. In the setting of finite groups, we\nrefine the cyclic group Brauer construction and categorify the Glauberman\ncorrespondence. In the setting of degenerate categorical Heisenberg actions, we\nobtain a rich collection of functors which commute with the categorical action.\nApplied to well-known categorifications of the basic representation and Fock\nspace, our functors give explicit realizations of periodic equivalences for\npolynomial functors and symmetric groups first studied by Henke-Koenig. This\nallows us to globalize the equivalences of Henke-Koenig by symmetric monoidal\nfunctors. We apply these results to deduce branching properties of certain\nmodular representations of $S_n$."}
