In practice, to better suit the functionalities of cryptosystems, one often needs to modify the original Weil pairing via what is called a distortion map. We propose a study on the question of the existence of distortion maps for elliptic curves over finite fields. We revisit results from the literature and provide detailed proofs. We also propose new perspectives at times."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "In this paper we obtain several results related to the $p$-adic interpolation of the classical Cogdell lift, mapping special cycles on Picard modular surfaces to elliptic modular forms. The results have a three-fold nature: in the first part of the paper, we $p$-adically interpolate the adjoint Kudla lift, exploiting the previously constructed $Λ$-adic Kudla lift. In the second part, we construct higher weight cycles in Kuga-Sato varieties attached to Picard modular surfaces, and show modularity of the generating series of these cycles, thus obtaining a higher weight analogue of the Cogdell lift. Finally, we apply the formalism introduced by Loeffler to construct $p$-adic analytic cohomology classes of special cycles, whose generating series is proved to be a Hida family interpolating the Cogdell lifts in the weight and level variables."}

We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions. In particular, we show that the number of new Kostant cuspidal elements can be arbitrarily large, when the rank grows. This provides some potential explanation why Kostant's problem is hard."}

Our approach is different from others in the literature in that there is no non-modularity assumption. We prove, when the field is algebraically closed, the analogue of the Main Theorem of the representation theory of Galois orders by V. Futorny and S. Ovsienko. Then we develop a theory of infinite rank generalized Weyl algebras, which was never explicitly introduced in the literature before, and prove its basic properties. We expect their representation theory to be of interest for future works. Finally we show that under very mild assumptions, the invariants of generalized Weyl algebras under the action of non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups are a principal Galois orders, greatly generalizing, in an elementary fashion, results obtained previously for the Weyl algebras."}

A probabilistic argument using the Haar measure on the absolute Galois group of a number field shows that almost all such fields are Kummer-faithful, i.e., the Mordell--Weil group of any semiabelian variety over any finite extension of such a field has trivial divisible part. This result implies that there exists a Kummer-faithful field algebraic over a number field whose absolute Galois group is abelian."}

We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $Λ$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $Λ$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \\otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms."}
