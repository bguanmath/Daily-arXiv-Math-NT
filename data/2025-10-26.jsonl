As examples, through a new derivation, we\nreproduce classical continued fraction expansions for the natural logarithm,\nthe Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$, and polylogarithms, while also obtaining\nseveral new identities. Finally, we apply the method to construct a divergent\ncontinued fraction, which provides a natural assignment of the Euler Mascheroni\nconstant $\\gamma$ as the sum of a particular divergent series through a new\nsummation method which we propose."}
