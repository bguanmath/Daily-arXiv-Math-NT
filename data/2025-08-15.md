Abstract: Generalizing the theory of parity sheaves on complex algebraic stacks due to
Juteau-Mautner-Williamson, we develop a theory of twisted equivariant parity
sheaves. We use this formalism to construct a modular incarnation of Lusztig
and Yun's monodromic Hecke category. We then give two applications: (1) a
modular categorification of the monodromic Hecke algebra, and (2) a monoidal
equivalence between the monodromic Hecke category of parity sheaves and the
ordinary Hecke category of parity sheaves on the endoscopic group.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Brylinski-Kostant filtration on a representation of a finite-dimensional
semisimple Lie algebra has interpretations in terms of the algebra, geometry
and combinatorics of the representation. Its extension to affine Lie algebras
was first studied by Slofstra. Recent work of the present authors constructed a
Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt type basis for the dominant weight spaces of the
basic representation of affine Lie algebras of type $A$, which is compatible
with the affine Brylinski filtration. In this paper, we overcome the constraint
of type dependence, and furnish a new, uniform proof which holds for all
simply-laced affine Lie algebras.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强Gelfand对对于理解群及其子群之间的表示性质很重要，特别是当诱导特征标在母群中为无乘子形式时。

Abstract: A strong Gelfand pair $(G, H)$ is a finite group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ where
every irreducible character of $H$ induces to a multiplicity-free character of
$G$. We determine the strong Gelfand pairs of the dihedral groups $D_{2n}$ and
the dicyclic groups $Dic_{4n}$ for all $n$.

### [4] [On the Degenerate Whittaker space for some induced representations of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10796)
*Ankita Parashar,Shiv Prakash Patel*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper explores the degenerate Whittaker space for some induced representations of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$, building upon Prasad's conjecture related to representations over a finite principal ideal ring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the degenerate Whittaker space structure behaves beyond the realm of strongly cuspidal representations, providing deeper insights into the representation theory for general linear groups over local rings.

Method: The paper likely employs techniques from representation theory, specifically studying induced representations from subgroups similar to maximal parabolic subgroups of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and applies known properties of Prasad's conjecture to derive the structure of the Whittaker space in these cases.

Result: The structure of the degenerate Whittaker space for certain induced representations of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$ is described, extending the results of Prasad's conjecture beyond strongly cuspidal representations.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the characterization of degenerate Whittaker spaces in the context of induced representations, enhancing the understanding of how these spaces interact with parabolic-like subgroups and representations over local rings.

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{o}_l$ be a finite principal ideal local ring of length $l$.
The degenerate Whittaker space associated with a representation of ${\rm
GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ is a representation of ${\rm GL}_n(\mathfrak{o}_l)$.
For strongly cuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ the
structure of degenerate Whittaker space is described by Prasad's conjecture,
which has been proven for ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$. In this paper, we
describe the degenerate Whittaker space for certain induced representations of
${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$, specifically those induced from subgroups
analogous to the maximal parabolic subgroups of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_q)$.

### [5] [Bicharacter twists of quantum groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10882)
*Ian Martin,Alexander Tsymbaliuk*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper uses skew bicharacters to twist bigraded Hopf algebras, generating various two-parameter quantum groups from one-parameter versions. This results in simpler proofs and potential generalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate a unified approach for constructing two-parameter quantum groups from bigraded Hopf algebras using skew bicharacters, simplifying existing proofs and enabling new generalizations.

Method: The method involves applying a twist to bigraded Hopf algebras through skew bicharacters, leading to the derivation of two-parameter quantum groups in Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld, and FRT presentations.

Result: New elementary proofs of existing results on two-parameter quantum groups are presented, and generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases are explored.

Conclusion: The twist approach by skew bicharacters provides a straightforward and general framework for understanding and constructing two-parameter quantum groups and their extensions.

Abstract: We apply the general construction of a twist of bigraded Hopf algebras by
skew bicharacters to obtain two-parameter quantum groups in the Drinfeld-Jimbo,
new Drinfeld (for affine types), and FRT (for both finite and affine)
presentations from their standard one-parameter versions. This yields new
elementary proofs of the fundamental results on two-parameter quantum groups
that appeared in the literature over the last two decades, and also leads to
natural generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases.

### [6] [On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153)
*Kenneth G. Monks*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer
$x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$
for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps
$x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In
particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$.
This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the
conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any
correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend
their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic
integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that
correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power
series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon
F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$
otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some
of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive
integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that
$T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the
orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two
fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these
conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by
replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic
integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could
settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for
both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.

### [7] [Local-global compatibility and the exceptional zero conjecture for GL(3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10225)
*Daniel Barrera Salazar,Andrew Graham,Chris Williams*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove the exceptional zero conjecture of Greenberg--Benois for
$p$-ordinary regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of
$\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A})$ which are Steinberg at $p$. In particular, we
obtain the first cases of this conjecture for non-essentially-self-dual RACARs
of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A})$.
  Our proof has two main parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to
prove an exceptional zero formula using Gehrmann's automorphic
$\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove the equality of automorphic and
Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants. As one of the key ingredients for
this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois
representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$,
confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$
following the strategy in the "10-author paper," and use the $n=3$ case to
deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.

### [8] [Supercharacters of finite abelian groups and applications to spectra of $U$-unitary Cayley graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10348)
*Tung T. Nguyen,Nguyen Duy Tân*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We define super-Cayley graphs over a finite abelian group $G$. Using the
theory of supercharacters on $G$, we explain how their spectra can be realized
as a super-Fourier transform of a superclass characteristic function.
Consequently, we show that a super-Cayley graph is determined by its spectrum
once an indexing on the underlying group $G$ is fixed. This generalizes a
theorem by Sander-Sander, which investigates the case where $G$ is a cyclic
group. We then use our theory to define and study the concept of a $U$-unitary
Cayley graph over a finite commutative ring $R$, where $U$ is a subgroup of the
unit group of $R$. Furthermore, when the underlying ring is a Frobenius ring,
we show that there is a natural supercharacter theory associated with $U$. By
applying the general theory of super-Cayley graphs developed in the first part,
we explore various spectral properties of these $U$-unitary Cayley graphs,
including their rationality and connections to various arithmetical sums.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let Fq be the finite field with q elements, and K an algebraic function field
over with Fq as its field of constants. Let S be a finite nonempty set of prime
divisors over K, and OS be the ring of integers of K attached to S. Let w
greater than 1 be an integer. In this work we shall count w coprime S integers
and S integral ideals, and our proofs are a combination of analytic methods and
the Riemann Roch theorem and the Weil theorem for function fields in positive
characteristic.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 2024, M. K. Ram proved that the class number of an imaginary cyclic
quartic number field is never equal to a prime $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$. Here we
greatly generalize this result to the case of the non-quadratic imaginary
cyclic number fields of $2$-power degrees and not necessarily prime class
numbers.

Abstract: We give an equivalent condition for the validity of the Hasse norm principle

theorem recovers the result of Drakokhrust--Platonov, which claims that the
Hasse norm principle holds for adequate extensions of prime squared degree.

### [13] [A Canonical Bijection Between Finite-Decimal Real Numbers and Natural Numbers with Constant-Time Enumeration Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10750)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an explicit bijection between finite-decimal real numbers and
natural numbers ($\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$) using a systematic 4-tuple
parametrization with closed-form mathematical formulas for enumeration. Our
enumeration system provides complete indexing of all real numbers with
terminating decimal representations through the parametrization $(\text{sign},
N_1, N_2, N_3)$. Both forward and inverse mappings execute in O(1) constant
time, achieved through closed-form lexicographic positioning formulas that
eliminate enumeration loops. The system uses exact decimal arithmetic
throughout, ensuring perfect accuracy across all representable numbers. This
bijective correspondence demonstrates that finite-decimal real numbers can be
systematically enumerated and indexed with optimal constant-time computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解二级模数微分方程的等变解可以帮助深入探索模数空间的独特属性和这些方程背后的数学结构。

Method: 我们使用一个涉及艾森斯坦级数和J不变量的明确假设来构建等变解。这将问题归结为一个代数系统，其中的解通过满足富克斯微分方程的正交多项式捕获。

Result: 我们将所有等变解的构造问题归结为代数系统，并且同时展示了这些解的根被满足富克斯微分方程的正交多项式捕获。此外，我们还推导了这些多项式的递归关系、范数和权重函数，从而在此设置中完成了等变解的分类。

Conclusion: 本论文通过使用艾森斯坦级数和J不变量，提供了一个用于构造二级模数微分方程的等变解的方法，并完全分类了在可简化情形下的等变解。

Abstract: We study second-order modular differential equations whose solutions
transform equivariantly under the modular group. In the reducible case, we
construct all such solutions using an explicit ansatz involving Eisenstein
series and the $J$-invariant, reducing the problem to an algebraic system. We
show that the roots of this system are captured by orthogonal polynomials
satisfying a Fuchsian differential equation. Their recurrence, norms, and
weight function are derived, completing the classification of equivariant
solutions in this setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of
$\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ with unitary central characters. We
establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the
Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's
refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. A crucial component of
our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of
$L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a
possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur
only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and
Thorner.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 2016, the first-named author introduced a formulation of the Alternative
Hypothesis that assumes that consecutive zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are
spaced at multiples of half of the average spacing, but does not assume that
the zeros are simple. In this paper, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis and a
similar formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis, and for each integer $k$ we
obtain constraints on the density of pairs of zeros whose normalized
differences are at $k/2$ times the average spacing. These constraints, in turn,
restrict the density of (possible) multiple zeros. We also formulate a stronger
version of the Alternative Hypothesis and show that it implies the Essential
Simplicity Hypothesis.
