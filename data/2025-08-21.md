Abstract: We determine the quadratic points on the modular curves $X_0(N)$ for $N\leq
100$ for which this has not been previously done, namely the cases
  $$N\in\{66,70,78,82,84,86,87,88,90,96,99\}.$$
  We accomplish this by improving on the ``going down method," which uses the
fact that we have a moduli description of all the (infinitely many) quadratic
points on $X_0(n)$ for some divisor $n$ of $N$.

### [2] [Shifted moments of cubic and quartic Dirichlet $L$-functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14534)
*Peng Gao,Liangyi Zhao*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper establishes upper bounds for shifted moments of cubic and quartic L-functions and shows that these bounds can be applied to the study of Dirichlet character sums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of moments in L-functions is crucial for understanding their distribution and behavior, which has implications in number theory. By providing upper bounds under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, the paper contributes to the theoretical framework that supports various conjectures and applications in analytic number theory.

Method: The authors utilize techniques from analytic number theory, particularly focusing on the properties of cubic and quartic Dirichlet L-functions. They derive upper bounds for shifted moments, which involves analyzing the function's behavior and applying the generalized Riemann hypothesis as a foundational assumption.

Result: The results are the derived upper bounds for the shifted moments of both cubic and quartic Dirichlet L-functions. Additionally, the study proves bounds for moments of cubic and quartic Dirichlet character sums.

Conclusion: The paper's conclusion highlights the successful derivation of upper bounds under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, which can be applied to further research on character sums and the distribution of values of these L-functions.

Abstract: We establish upper bounds for shifted moments of cubic and quartic Dirichlet
$L$-functions under the generalized Riemann hypothesis. As an application, we
prove bounds for moments of cubic and quartic Dirichlet character sums.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish an asymptotic formula for counting integer solutions with smooth
weights to an equation of the form $xy-zw=r$, where $r$ is a non-zero integer,
with an explicit main term and a strong bound on the error term in terms of the
size of the variables $x, y, z, w$ as well as of $r$. We also establish an
asymptotic formula for counting integer solutions with smooth weights to the
congruence $xy-zw \equiv 1 (\text{mod }p)$, where $p$ is a large prime, with a
strong bound on the error term.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{F}_n$ be the set of unitary cuspidal automorphic
representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$, and let
$\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathfrak{F}_n$ be a finite subset. Given
$\pi_0\in\mathfrak{F}_{n_0}$, we establish large sieve inequalities for the
families $\{L(s,\pi)\colon \pi\in\mathcal{S}\}$ and
$\{L(s,\pi\times\pi_0)\colon \pi\in\mathcal{S}\}$ that, unlike previous
results, are independent of progress towards the generalized Ramanujan
conjecture and simultaneously handle the Dirichlet coefficients of $L$,
$L^{-1}$, and $\log L$. Our approach is based on the duality principle and is
sharp in ranges that are complementary to large sieve inequalities based on
trace formulae. We apply our large sieve inequalities to establish several
density estimates for families of $L$-functions, counting potential violations
of the generalized Riemann hypothesis and the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.
In particular, we remove all restrictions in the log-free zero density estimate
of Brumley, Thorner, and Zaman for families of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the structure of the `exotic nilcone' of $F_4$ which is
defined by exploiting certain characteristic two phenomena. We show that there
are finitely many orbits on this nilcone and construct an associated Springer
correspondence. Further to that, we show that all corresponding `exotic
Springer fibers' admit an affine paving. We also deduce from this a geometric
classification of certain simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra with
unequal parameters of type $F_4$.

### [7] [An update on Heisenberg and Kac-Moody categorification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14378)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Heisenberg categories act on many Abelian categories appearing in type A
representation theory. There is also a general procedure to construct from a
Heisenberg action another action of a Kac-Moody 2-category for some associated
Cartan matrix. One of the adjunctions on the Kac-Moody side is matched up in an
easy way with adjunctions on the Heisenberg side, but the second adjunction is
much harder to describe. In this paper, we derive explicit formulae for this
difficult adjunction, leading to some further simplifications to the existing
theory.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ be symmetrically separably equivalent Artin
algebras. We prove that there exist symmetrical separable equivalences between
certain endomorphism algebras of modules. As applications, we provide several
methods to construct symmetrical separable equivalences from given ones and
discuss when the rigidity dimension is an invariant under symmetrical separable
equivalences. Moreover, we show that a symmetrical separable equivalence
preserves the Frobenius-finite type, Auslander-type condition, the (strong)
Nakayama conjecture, the Auslander-Gorenstein conjecture and so on.

### [9] [Centralizers in Hecke Algebras of Any Coxeter Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14473)
*Haiyu Chen*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the centralizer of a parabolic subalgebra in the Hecke algebra
associated with an arbitrary (possibly infinite) Coxeter group. While the
center and cocenter have been extensively studied in the finite and affine
cases, much less is known in the indefinite setting. We describe a basis for
the centralizer, generalizing known results about the center. Our approach
combines algebraic techniques with geometric tools from the Davis complex, a
CAT(0)-space associated to the Coxeter group. As part of the construction, we
classify finite partial conjugacy classes in infinite Coxeter groups and define
a variant of the class polynomial adapted to the centralizer.

### [10] [On the classification and irreducibility of $2$-local representations of the twin group $T_n$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14505)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the homogeneous $2$-local representations of the twin group
$T_n$ for all integers $n\geqslant 2$. A complete classification is obtained,
yielding three distinct families of representations. We show that each of these
families is reducible by explicitly constructing one-dimensional invariant
subspaces, with particular emphasis on the first family, namely $\xi_1: T_n
\rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. Passing to the corresponding quotients,
we construct a reduced representation of $\xi_1$, namely $\tilde{\xi}_1: T_n
\rightarrow \text{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$. The core of the paper is that we
establish, through a precise criterion, a necessary and sufficient condition
for the irreducibility of the representation $\tilde{\xi}_1$.

### [11] [On the Right Derived Functors of Ordinary Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14598)
*Manuel Hoff,Sarah Diana Meier,Michael Spieß,Claudius Heyer*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The authors prove a variant of Emerton's conjecture on the ordinary parts functor, and as a result, provide an explicit description of Vignéras' right adjoint to parabolic induction. They also establish a mod p version of Bernstein’s Second Adjointness in the appendix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address Emerton's conjecture, which is significant in the theory of mod $p$ representations of $p$-adic reductive groups. Such representations play a crucial role in number theory and automorphic forms, particularly in understanding their structure and properties under various functors.

Method: The proof involves comparing certain small and parabolic inductions, which allows the authors to analyze and understand the derived functors of the ordinary parts functor $\operatorname{Ord}_P^G$. Additionally, this technique leads to the explicit description of Vignéras' right adjoint to parabolic induction.

Result: The main result is a variant of Emerton's conjecture. An explicit description of Vignéras' right adjoint to parabolic induction is derived via the method of comparing inductions. The mod $p$ variant of Bernstein’s Second Adjointness is established.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the theory of mod $p$ representations by proving a key conjecture and offering explicit descriptions and adjoint relationships in the derived category setting, which may open new avenues for further research and applications.

Abstract: We prove a variant of Emerton's conjecture concerning the right derived
functors of the ordinary parts functor $\operatorname{Ord}_P^G$. This functor
plays an important role in the theory of mod $p$ representations of $p$-adic
reductive groups. A key ingredient for our proof is a comparison between
certain small and parabolic inductions. Additionally, our method yields an
explicit description of Vign\'eras' right adjoint to parabolic induction.
  In the appendix (joint with Heyer) we apply our results to obtain a mod $p$
variant of Bernstein's Second Adjointness, i.e. we show that the right and left
adjoint of derived parabolic induction are isomorphic (on complexes with
admissible cohomology) up to a cohomological shift and twist by a character.

### [12] [An explicit construction of the Weyl module as a quotient of symmetric tensors by dual Garnir relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14788)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Weyl modules are the standard modules for the Schur algebra. Their duals
(the costandard modules) have well-known constructions as quotients of exterior
powers and as submodules of symmetric powers. This paper presents analogous
constructions for the Weyl modules themselves, introducing relations that are a
non-trivial dualisation of the Garnir relations. More generally, our
constructions describe endofunctors on the category of representations of any
group.

### [13] [Entropy of the Serre functor for partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces with stops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14860)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that the entropy of the Serre functor $\mathbb{S}$ in the partially
wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface $\Sigma$ with stops is given by the
function sending $t \in \mathbb{R}$ to $ h_t(\mathbb{S}) = (1-\min \Omega)t$,
for $t\geq 0$, and to $h_t(\mathbb{S})=(1-\max \Omega)t$, for $t\leq 0$, where
$\Omega = \{\frac{\omega_1}{m_1} \ldots, \frac{\omega_b}{m_b},0\}$, and
$\omega_i$ is the winding number of the $i$th boundary component
$\partial_i\Sigma$ of the surface with $b$ boundary components and $m_i$ stops
on $\partial_i \Sigma$. It then follows that the upper and lower Serre
dimensions are given by $1-\min \Omega$ and $1-\max \Omega$, respectively.
Furthermore, in the case of a finite dimensional gentle algebra $A$, we show
that a Gromov-Yomdin-like equality holds by relating the categorical entropy of
the Serre functor of the perfect derived category of $A$ to the logarithm of
the spectral radius of the Coxeter transformation.
