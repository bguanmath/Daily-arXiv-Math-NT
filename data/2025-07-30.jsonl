For special values of the parameters, these Lambert\nseries are expressible in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein\nseries twisted by the same characters and the transseries representation is a\ndirect consequence of the action of Fricke involution on such twisted\nEisenstein series. When the parameters of the Lambert series are generic the\ntransseries representation provides for a quantum-modular version of Fricke\ninvolution which for a particular example we show being equivalent to modular\nresurgent structures found in topological strings observables."}
