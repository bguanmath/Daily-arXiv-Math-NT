Abstract: In contrast to the theory of tilting modules, in the dual theory, there is
not a unified definition. However, there are several definitions proposed for
cotilting modules. In this paper, we compare four of the main definitions for
cotilting modules that have been put forward.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group, and $\mathfrak{g}$ its Lie algebra. It is well
known that a $G$-module $V$ carrying an invariant symplectic form or an
invariant scalar product gives rise to a Hamiltonian Poisson space with a
quadratic moment maps $\mu$. We show that under condition ${\rm
Hom}_{\mathfrak{g}}(\wedge^3 V, S^3V)=0$ this space can be viewed as a
quasi-Poisson space with the same bivector, and with the group valued moment
map $\Phi = \exp \circ \mu$. Furthermore, we show that by modifying the
bivector by the standard $r$-matrix for $\mathfrak{g}$ one obtains a space with
a Poisson action of the Poisson-Lie group $G$, and with the moment map in the
sense of Lu taking values in the dual Poisson-Lie group $G^\ast$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a
cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean
local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the
defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among
other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form
$x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by
expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial
$x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we
compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary
assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the
special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is
equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work
in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals
for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach.
Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined
using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$, what are all functions $f \colon \mathbb{F}
\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f \left(
(x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in
$\mathbb{F}$? We solve this problem for the fields $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$,
and a class of its subfields that includes the real constructible numbers, the
real algebraic numbers, and all quadratic number fields. We also solve it over
the complex numbers and on any subfield of $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous
over the reals. The proofs involve a mix of algebra in all fields, analysis
over the real line, and some topology in the complex plane.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law,
describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from
continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we
prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in
higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the
real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure.
  Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff
averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to
show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it
satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic
theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective
multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow,
extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As
a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine
statistics in both classical and fractal settings.

Abstract: The study of gaps arising in binary cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{pq}$ is the
interest of this paper. We compute the second gap of $\Phi_{pq}$. When $q$ is
congruent to $\pm 1$ modulo $p$, we provide the number of gaps for each
possible length.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An isolated point of degree $d$ is a closed point on an algebraic curve which
does not belong to an infinite family of degree $d$ points that can be
parameterized by some geometric object. We provide an algorithm to test whether
a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated point on the modular
curve $X_0(n)$, for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, using key results from Menendez
and Zywina. This work is inspired by the prior algorithm of Bourdon et al.
which tests whether a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated
point on any modular curve $X_1(n)$. From the implementation of our algorithm,
we determine that the set of $j$-invariants corresponding to isolated points on
$X_1(n)$ is neither a subset nor a superset of those corresponding to isolated
points on $X_0(n)$.
