We establish that the set $\\mathcal{C}$ of covering\nnumbers possesses a natural density $d(\\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 <\nd(\\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend\nand Del\\'eglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a\nfunction $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering\nnumber with the property that $c(n) \\leq h(n) = \\sigma(n)/n$. However,\ncomputing $d(\\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to\nsimplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain\nsignificantly improved bounds for $d(\\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant\nnumbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$.
