Such a partial order -- called a\nquasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module\n$T_{\\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to\ndetermine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting\nmodules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module,\nwhich is a pair $(T,\\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order\n$\\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along\n$\\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a\ntilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\\unlhd$ so\nthat $(T,\\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\\unlhd}$. This\nresult enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory.\n  As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all\ntilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear\nNakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of\nthe set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula\nfor enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the\nquasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree\nsequences."}
