Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps\n$x\\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In\nparticular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$.\nThis seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the\nconjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any\ncorrespondence between polynomials and positive integers.\n  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend\ntheir domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic\nintegers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that\ncorrespond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power\nseries.\n  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\\colon\nF_2[[q]]\\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$\notherwise, where $A,B\\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some\nof these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive\nintegers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that\n$T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the\norbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two\nfixed points.\n  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these\nconjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by\nreplacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic\ninteger. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could\nsettle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for\nboth $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this paper, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis and a\nsimilar formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis, and for each integer $k$ we\nobtain constraints on the density of pairs of zeros whose normalized\ndifferences are at $k/2$ times the average spacing. These constraints, in turn,\nrestrict the density of (possible) multiple zeros. We also formulate a stronger\nversion of the Alternative Hypothesis and show that it implies the Essential\nSimplicity Hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
