It is a classical result that the pairs $(p,q)$ attaining these approximation constants arise from the convergents $(p_n,q_n)$ of the continued fraction of $α$. Consequently, $k(α)=\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}|q_n(q_nα-p_n)|^{-1}$. Moreira proved that the function $d(t)=HD(L\\cap(-\\infty,t))$ where $HD$ denotes Hausdorff dimension, is continuous.\n  Second Lagrange spectra are defined analogously to the classical Lagrange spectrum, but are associated with the problem of approximating an irrational number $α$ by rational numbers $\\frac{p}{q}$ that are not convergents of its continued fraction expansion. Two natural definitions arise depending on whether rational multiples $(p,q)=(kp_n,kq_n),k\\geq 2$ which represent the same rational numbers as convergents, are allowed or excluded. Based on this distinction, Moshchevitin introduced two second Lagrange spectra, denoted $L_2$ and $L_2^*$.\n  We prove that the function $d_2(t)=HD(L_2\\cap (-\\infty,t))$ is continuous, whereas $d_2^*(t)=HD(L_2^*\\cap (-\\infty,t))$ is discontinuous and assumes only the values 0 and 1."}

Given fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ containing $μ_p$, with intersection $k$ and compositum $K = K_1K_2$, we formulate an abstract composita stability theorem: under a pro-$p$ amalgam decomposition $G_K \\cong G_{K_1} *_{G_k} G_{K_2}$ of maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups, and natural Mayer-Vietoris compatibility assumptions on the mod-$p$ cohomology rings $H^\\bullet(G_{K_1},\\mathbb F_p)$, $H^\\bullet(G_{K_2},\\mathbb F_p)$, and $H^\\bullet(G_k,\\mathbb F_p)$, the quadratic presentation of $H^\\bullet(G_K,\\mathbb F_p)$ arises from a fiber-product construction on degree-$1$ generators and quadratic relations. Assuming stability of universal Koszulity under this quadratic gluing, we obtain that universal Koszulity of $H^\\bullet(G_{K_1},\\mathbb F_p)$ and $H^\\bullet(G_{K_2},\\mathbb F_p)$ implies universal Koszulity of $H^\\bullet(G_K,\\mathbb F_p)$. As a concrete application, we prove a composita stability theorem for certain Pythagorean fields whose maximal pro-$2$ Galois groups decompose as free pro-$2$ products of Demuškin groups and free factors. For suitable composita $K = K_1K_2$ of such fields, the mod-$2$ Galois cohomology ring $H^\\bullet(G_K(2),\\mathbb F_2)$ remains quadratic and universally Koszul. This provides large classes of fields, built from local, global, and Pythagorean base fields by admissible extensions and composita, whose maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups have universally Koszul cohomology, and yields inverse Galois obstructions: any finitely generated pro-$p$ group with nonquadratic or non-universally Koszul mod-$p$ cohomology cannot occur as the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field in these families."}

They gave several other examples of quadratic irrational series for $1/π$, and noted that the conjugate series converges to another rational multiple of $1/π$ or in some cases the conjugate series diverges.\n  The purpose of this work is to provide an explanation and classification of such series. Our classification includes Ramanujan's 17 original series, as well as series of the Borweins, Chudnovskys, Sato and others.

The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex.
