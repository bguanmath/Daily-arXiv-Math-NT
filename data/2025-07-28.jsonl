The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among\nother things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form\n$x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by\nexpressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial\n$x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we\ncompute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary\nassertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the\nspecial case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is\nequivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work\nin that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals\nfor an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach.\nOur direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined\nusing quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting."}

More generally, we\nprove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in\nhigher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the\nreal line, including the middle-third Cantor measure.\n  Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff\naverages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to\nshow that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it\nsatisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic\ntheorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective\nmulti-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow,\nextending recent work on single equidistribution by B\\'enard, He and Zhang. As\na consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine\nstatistics in both classical and fractal settings."}
