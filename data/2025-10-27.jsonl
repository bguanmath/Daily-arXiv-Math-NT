This is by way of an isogeny degree bound in this setting,\ngenerated from bounds for elliptic curves by Griffon--Pazuki, and techniques\noriginated by Serre and Masser--W\\\"{u}stholz in the number field setting. We\napply our result to prove that most members of a family of products of elliptic\ncurves over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with no extra endomorphisms have no exceptional primes\nabove a specified constant which depends neither on the elliptic curve factors\nnor on the dimension of the product."}
