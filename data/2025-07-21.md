Abstract: We prove the higher Siegel--Weil formula for \emph{corank one} terms,
relating (1) the $r^{\rm th}$ central derivatives of corank one Fourier
coefficients of Siegel--Eisenstein series, and (2) the degrees of special
cycles of virtual dimension 0 on the moduli stack of Hermitian shtukas with $r$
legs. Notably, the formula holds for all $r$, regardless of the order of
vanishing of the Eisenstein series. This extends earlier work of
Feng--Yun--Zhang, who proved the higher Siegel--Weil formula for the
non-singular (corank zero) terms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group over the ring of integers of a
finite unramified extension $K$ of $\mathbf{Q}_p$. Under a standard assumption
on the Coxeter number of $G$, we compute the cohomology algebra of
$G(\mathcal{O}_K)$ and its Iwahori subgroups, with coefficients in the residue
field of $K$. Our methods involve a new presentation of some graded Lie
algebras appearing in Lazard's theory of saturated $p$-valued groups, and a
reduction to coherent cohomology of the flag variety in positive
characteristic. We also consider the case of those inner forms of
$\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ that give rise to the Morava stabilizer groups in stable
homotopy theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Standard prime-number counting functions, such as $\psi(x)$, $\theta(x)$, and
$\pi(x)$, have error terms with limiting logarithmic distributions once
suitably normalized. The same is true of weighted versions of those sums, like
$\pi_r(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \frac1p$ and $\pi_\ell(x) = \sum_{p\le x}
\log(1-\frac1p)^{-1}$, that were studied by Mertens. These limiting
distributions are all identical, but passing to the limit loses information
about how these error terms are correlated with one another.
  In this paper, we examine these correlations, showing, for example, that
persistent inequalities between certain pairs of normalized error terms are
equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (RH). Assuming both RH and LI, the linear
independence of the positive imaginary parts of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, we
calculate the logarithmic densities of the set of real numbers for which two
different error terms have prescribed signs. For example, we conditionally show
that $\psi(x) - x$ and $\sum_{n\le x} \frac{\Lambda(n)}n - (\log x - C_0)$ have
the same sign on a set of logarithmic density $\approx 0.9865$.

Abstract: Generalized $m$-gonal numbers are those $p_m(x)= [ (m - 2)x^2 - (m - 4)x ]/2
$ where $x$ and $m$ are integers with $m \geq 3$. If any nonnegative integer
can be written in the form $ap_r(h)+bp_s(l)+cp_t(m)+dp_u(n)$, where $a,b,c,d$
are positive integers, then we call $ap_r(h)+bp_s(l)+cp_t(m)+dp_u(n)$ a
universal quaternary sum. In this paper, we determine the universality of many
quaternary sums when $r,s,t,u \in \{3,4,5,8\}$, using the theory of Ramanujan's
theta function identities

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A generalization of the well-known Fibonacci sequence is the $k$-Fibonacci
sequence with some fixed integer $k\ge 2$. The first $k$ terms of this sequence
are $0,0, \ldots, 1$, and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding $k$
terms. In this paper, we find all Pell numbers that can be written as a product
of two $k$-Fibonacci numbers. The proof of our main theorem uses lower bounds
for linear forms in logarithms, properties of continued fractions, and a
variation of a result of Dujella and Peth\H{o} in Diophantine approximation.
This work generalizes a prior result of Alekseyev which dealt with determining
the intersection of the Fibonacci and Pell sequences, a work of Ddamulira, Luca
and Rakotomalala who searched for Pell numbers which are products of two
Fibonacci numbers, and a result of Bravo, G\'omez, and Herrera, who found all
Pell numbers appearing in the $k$-Fibonacci sequence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide for a wide class of zero-free regions an upper bound for the error
term in the Prime Number Theorem, refining works of Pintz (1980), Johnston
(2024), and R\'ev\'esz (2024). Our method does not only apply to the Riemann
zeta function, but to general Beurling zeta functions. Next we construct
Beurling zeta functions having infinitely many zeros on a prescribed contour,
and none to the right, for a wide class of such contours. We also deduce an
oscillation result for the corresponding error term in the Prime Number
Theorem, showing that our aforementioned refinement is close to being sharp.

Abstract: K.T. Chen showed that iterated integrals give comparison isomorphisms between

iterated integrals. In this paper we consider an analogue of this comparison
isomorphism theorem for iterated integrals on the Legendre family.

Abstract: We characterize all algebraic numbers $\alpha$ of degree $d\in\{4,5,6,7\}$
for which there exist four distinct algebraic conjugates $\alpha_1$,
$\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$, $\alpha_4$ of $\alpha$ satisfying the relation
$\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}$. In particular, we prove that an
algebraic number $\alpha$ of degree 6 satisfies this relation with
$\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $\alpha$ is the sum of a
quadratic and a cubic algebraic number. Moreover, we describe all possible
Galois groups of the normal closure of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for such algebraic
numbers $\alpha$. We also consider similar relations
$\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}=0$ and
$\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}=\alpha_{4}$ for algebraic numbers of degree
up to 7.

Abstract: Approximation theorems for algebraic stacks over a number field $k$ are

field we prove strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction for the
classifying stack $BG$. This result answers a very concrete question, given
$G$-torsors $P_v$ over $k_v$, where $v$ ranges over a finite number of places,
when can you approximate the $P_v$ by a $G$-torsor $P$ defined over $k$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study multiple $\wp$-functions, which
generalize the classical Weierstrass $\wp$-function to iterated sums over
lattice points, and we establish explicit formulas expressing them in terms of
single $\wp$-functions with coefficients given by multiple Eisenstein series.
As an application, we derive some relations among multiple Eisenstein series
and multiple zeta values by exploiting the double periodicity of the multiple
$\wp$-functions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A tensor space is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of
multi-linear forms. In recent years, a rich theory of infinite dimensional
tensor spaces has emerged. In this note, we show that a large class of
permutation groups can occur as the automorphism groups of such tensor spaces.
Using this, we show that a tensor space can behave somewhat pathologically as a
representation of its automorphism group.

Abstract: We prove a compatibility between parabolic restriction of Whittaker sheaves
and restriction of representations under the geometric Casselman-Shalika
equivalence. To do this, we establish various Hecke structures on geometric
Eisenstein series functors, generalizing results of Braverman-Gaitsgory in the
case of a principal parabolic. Moreover, we relate compactified and
non-compactified geometric Eisenstein series functors via Koszul duality.
  We sketch a proof that the spectral-to-automorphic geometric Langlands
functor commutes with constant term functors.

Abstract: Let $A$ be a gentle algebra. For every collection of string and band
diagrammes, we consider the constructible subset of the variety of
representations containing all modules with this underlying diagramme. We study
degenerations of such sets. We show that these sets are defined by vectors of
integers which we call $h$-vectors and which are related to a restricted
version of the hom-order. We provide combinatorial criteria for the existence
of a degeneration, involving the removal of an arrow or the resolving of a type
of configuration called "reaching".

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To the symmetric space of the (positive half) of a real loop group, we attach
a Borel--Serre type bordification and equip it with a Hausdorff topology. The
attached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is
shown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of
an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and
its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H.
Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre
construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the
center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop
groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently
Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space.
This partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient.

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper proposes an abelian categorification of $\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, aiming to establish a dictionary between these manifolds and log VOAs via 3d-3d correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from previous work arXiv:2501.12985 and the desire to understand the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory's influence on VOA structures, particularly in extending W-algebras.

Method: The method involves the recursive binary encoding of invariants in the abelian category over log VOAs and decoding using Feigin--Tipunin construction.

Result: The nested Weyl-type character formulas are developed, which produce generalised characters reconstructing $\hat{Z}$, contributing to extensions of W-algebras.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed theory extends and enhances the understanding of connections between 3-manifolds, VOAs, and W-algebras in the context of 3d-3d correspondence.

Abstract: In the spirit of arXiv:2501.12985, we propose an abelian categorification of
$\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds. It provides a
blueprint for the expected dictionary between these $3$-manifolds and log VOAs;
that is, the contribution from 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory via 3d-3d
correspondence is recursively binary encoded in the abelian category of modules
over the hypothetical log VOA, and is decoded by the recursive application of
the theory of Feigin--Tipunin construction. In particular, the nested Weyl-type
character formulas provide generalized characters reconstructing $\hat{Z}$. Our
theory also implies vast extensions of W-algebras in a new direction.

Abstract: What might a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients even
look like? We introduce a class of combinatorial objects called bitableaux,
which we believe are a natural candidate, and we formulate a purely
combinatorial problem which if resolved would give a combinatorial
interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. We make some partial progress on
this problem -- enough to extract a combinatorial expansion for a Kronecker
product of Schur functions in the monomial basis. We also explain how in this
framework finding a combinatorial interpretation for Kronecker coefficients can
be thought of as looking for a generalization of the RSK and dual RSK insertion
algorithms.

### [18] [Construction of Young modules and filtration multiplicities for Brauer algebras of type $C$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14078)
*Sulakhana Chowdhury,Geetha Thangavelu*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: We extend the representation theory of hyperoctahedral group algebras to the Brauer algebra of type $C$. In fact, we use this to construct permutation modules and Young modules for the Brauer algebra of type $C$ as well as a stratifying system. These results allow us to prove that permutation modules decompose into Young modules if the field carries is not $2$ or $3$. We also derive cohomology theorems for the hyperoctahedral group algebra needed for the proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We establish the representation theory of the Brauer algebra of type $C$. In this theory, understanding the decomposition into indecomposable modules is crucial. Permutation modules and Young modules are fundamental in the representation theory of Hecke algebras and of symmetric groups and their decomposition was a major topic in cite{GN1}, cite{F1}, and cite{F2}. Since the Brauer algebras of type $C$ representation theory has been underdeveloped in comparison with other structures, our work develops it in a manner analogous to symmetric groups and to Hecke algebras.

Method: We extend the work of Hemmer-Nakano cite{HN} by first constructing permutation modules and Young modules for the Brauer algebra of type $C$. This involves understanding the structure of the hyperoctahedral group algebras in the context of modular representation theory. To do this, we adapt and generalize the stratifying system approach introduced in cite{F1} (for $q$-Schur algebras) and in cite{HN} (for Hecke algebras), by associating the poset of $C$-link diagrams with a stratifying system, and studying how filtration properties interact with the inducing/reducing functors. Then, we use this to establish cohomological criteria in the hyperoctahedral group algebras, needed to prove the indecomposability results for the Brauer algebra of type $C$.

Result: Our results give general conditions under which the multiplicities of cell modules in any filtration are well-defined. In addition, we prove that if the field characteristic is not $2$ or $3$, then each permutation module $M(w)$, indexed by a $C$-link diagram $w$, for the Brauer algebra of type $C$ has a direct sum decomposition into Young modules. Furthermore, we derive several cohomological criteria.

Conclusion: The methods developed in the paper tie together multiple representation theoretic and cohomological strands in a systematic and novel way. We hope they serve as a central framework in future study of representation theory of other diagram algebras in non-semisimple settings. As such, our results pursue an understanding of the representation theory of the symmetric group, the Hecke algebra, and the Brauer algebra of type $C$, and place the theory in a common language.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the permutation modules and Young modules for
Brauer algebras of type $C$ by extending the representation theory of the group
algebra of hyperoctahedral groups. Additionally, we develop a stratifying
system for Brauer algebras of type $C$, thereby extending the work of
Hemmer-Nakano in \cite{HN} on Hecke algebras. This framework allows us to
determine when the multiplicities of cell modules in any filtration are
well-defined. As a result, we prove that if the characteristic of the field is
neither $2$ nor $3$, then every permutation module of the Brauer algebra of
type $C$ decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable Young modules. We also
establish certain cohomological criteria for the group algebra of the
hyperoctahedral groups, which are necessary to prove the results for the Brauer
algebras of type $C$.
