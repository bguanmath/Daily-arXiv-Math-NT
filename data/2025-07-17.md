Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with a family of sums involving the floor
function. With $r$ a non negative integer and $n$ and $m$ positive integers we
consider the sums
\begin{equation*}\mathbf{S}_{r}\left(n,m\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\left\lfloor
\frac{km}{n}\right\rfloor}^r\end{equation*} While a formula for $\mathbf{S}_1$
is well known, we provide closed-form formulas for $\mathbf{S}_2$ and
$\mathbf{S}_3$ as well as the reciprocity laws they satisfy. Additionally, one
can find a closed-form formula for the classical Dedekind sum using the
Euclidean algorithm. Finally, we provide a general formula for $\mathbf{S}_r$
showing its dependency on generalized Dedekind sums.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask
polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are
$s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials
$\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size
of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known
about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to
the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure
on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special
cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are
added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications,
including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set
conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime and $k$ be a natural number. We show that a finite
subset of integers $S$ that does not contain any perfect $q^{th}$ power,
contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every natural numbers $N$ with
at most $k$ prime factors if and only if $S$ corresponds to a $k$-blocking set
of $\PG(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$. Here, $n$ is the number of distinct primes that
divides the $q$-free parts of elements of $S$. Consequently, this geometric
connection enables us to utilize methods from Galois geometry to derive lower
bounds for the cardinalities of such sets $S$ and to completely characterize
such $S$ of the smallest and the second smallest cardinalities. Furthermore,
the property of whether a finite subset of integers contains a $q^{th}$ power
residue modulo almost every integer $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors is
invariant under the action of projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(n,
q)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We settle a conjecture proposed by B. Maji and T. Sarkar regarding the
location of zeros of a two-parameter family of reciprocal polynomials,
$R_{k,\ell}(z)$ for positive integers $k$ and $\ell$. These polynomials are
generalizations of Ramanujan polynomials studied by M. R. Murty, C. Smyth, and
R. Wang. More specifically, we show that except for two real zeros, all other
zeros of $R_{k,\ell}(z)$ lie on the unit circle.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the distribution of the sequence of the first $N$ elements of the
discrete dynamical system generated by the M\"obius transformation $x \mapsto
(\alpha x + \beta)/(\gamma x + \delta)$ over a finite field of $p$ elements at
the moments of time that correspond to $Q$-smooth numbers, that is, to numbers
composed out of primes up to $Q$. In particular, we obtain nontrivial estimates
of exponential sums with such sequences.

Abstract: For $N \geq 1$, let $S_{2}^{\text{new}}(N)$ denote the newspace of cuspidal
modular forms of weight $2$ and level $N$. In 2004, Greg Martin conjectured
that as a sequence in $N$, $\dim S_2^{\text{new}}(N)$ takes on all possible
natural numbers. In this paper, we investigate several generalizations and
variations of this type of problem. In each case, we provide a complete
characterization of when such a property holds.

Abstract: We count the number of Galois extensions $M/\mathbb{Q}$ with fixed Galois
group $\text{Gal}(M/\mathbb{Q})=D_4$ ordered by multi-invariants introduced by
Gundlach. We verify the asymptotic behavior predicted by Gundlach's version of
Malle's conjecture. We compare the leading constant to recent predictions by
Loughran and Santens.

### [8] [Quasimodular forms arising from Jacobi's theta function and special symmetric polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12352)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms
$U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the
generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of
quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a
weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form
$\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight
$n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars
$\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$
that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With
this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$
Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of
the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one
identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.

### [9] [On the Lebesgue-Nagell equation $x^2-2 = y^p$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12397)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the Lebesgue-Nagell equation \begin{align*}
  x^2-2=y^p \end{align*} in integers $x,y,p$ with $p\geq 3$ an odd prime. A
longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the
``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for
$p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>1831$ through a careful
application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show
that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y > 10^{1000}$. In addition, we
establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem,
and we revisit prior claims in the literature regarding unresolved cases of the
equation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study tensor categories that interpolate the representation categories of
finite classical groups. There are (at least) two ways to approach these
categories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths
and weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their
structure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a
certain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious.
Furthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same
categories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures
on the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct
categories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our
results rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite
geometry.

### [11] [Base change of (Gorenstein) transpose, k-torsionfree modules, and quasi-faithfully flat extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12219)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\varphi\colon R \rightarrow A$ be a finite ring homomorphism, where $R$
is a two-sided Noetherian ring, and let $M$ be a finitely generated left
$A$-module. Under suitable homological conditions on $A$ over $R$, we establish
a close relationship between the classical transpose of $M$ over $A$ and the
Gorenstein transpose of a certain syzygy module of $M$ over $R$. As an
application, for each integer $k>0$, we provide a sufficient condition under
which $M$ is $k$-torsionfree over $A$ if and only if a certain syzygy of $M$
over $R$ is $k$-torsionfree over $R$, extending a result of Zhao. We introduce
the notion of quasi-faithfully flat extensions and show that, under suitable
assumptions, the extension closedness of the category of $k$-torsionfree
modules over $R$ is equivalent to that over $A$. An application is an
affirmative answer to a question posed by Zhao concerning quasi
$k$-Gorensteiness, in the case where both $R$ and $A$ are Noetherian algebras.
Finally, when $\varphi$ is a separable split Frobenius extension, it is proved
that the category of $k$-torsionfree $R$-modules has finite representation type
if and only if the same holds over $A$, with applications to skew group rings.
