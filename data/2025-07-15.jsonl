We study sumsets in discrete abelian groups,\nwhere at least one summand has positive upper Banach density.\n  Renling Jin proved that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers having positive\nupper Banach density, then $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Bergelson, Furstenberg,\nand Weiss improved the conclusion to \"$A+B$ is piecewise Bohr.\" Beiglb\\\"ock,\nBergelson, and Fish showed this to be qualitatively optimal, in the sense that\nif $C\\subseteq \\mathbb Z$ is piecewise Bohr, then there are $A, B\\subseteq\n\\mathbb Z$ having positive upper Banach density such that $A+B\\subseteq C$.\n  We improve these results by establishing a strong correspondence between\nsumsets in discrete abelian groups, level sets of convolutions in compact\nabelian groups, and sumsets in compact abelian groups. Our proofs avoid measure\npreserving dynamics and nonstandard analysis, and our results apply to discrete\nabelian groups of any cardinality."}

This is an element of a\nglobal Hecke algebra associated with the double coset space\n$GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})\\backslash GL_2(\\mathbb{R})/O_2$. Eigenvalues of the global\nHecke-Baxter operator acting on the $GL_2$-Eisenstein series are given by the\ncorresponding global $L$-factors. This construction generalizes our previous\nconstruction of the Hecke-Baxter operators over local completions $\\mathbb{R}$\nand $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ of the number field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Presumably, zeroes of the\ncorresponding global $L$-factors should be subjected to an arithmetic version\nof the Bethe ansatz equations."}
