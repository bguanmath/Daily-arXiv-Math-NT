### [1] [Covariants and simultaneous diagonalization of pairs of ternary quadratic forms, and binary quartic forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03848)

Abstract: In this paper we prove a correspondence between a canonical degree six
covariant of binary quartic forms $F$ and a cubic covariant of a pair of
ternary quadratic forms $(f_A, f_B)$. In the process we obtain a canonical way
to diagonalize a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over any field $K$ of
characteristic zero. As a corollary, we give a precise criterion to decide
whether a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Q}$ is diagonalizable
over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We define $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$ as the number of overpartitions of $n$ in
which non-overlined parts are not divisible by $l$. In a recent work, Nath,
Saikia, and the second author established several families of congruences for
$\overline{R_l^*}(n)$, with particular focus on the cases $l=6$ and $l=8$. In
the concluding remarks of their paper, they conjectured that
$\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ satisfies an infinite family of congruences modulo $128$.
In this paper, we confirm their conjectures using elementary methods.
Additionally, we provide elementary proofs of two congruences for
$\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ previously proven via the machinery of modular forms by
Alanazi, Munagi, and Saikia.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Jin, Liu, and Xia \cite{JLX} presented some modulo 4
congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$, the number of smallest parts in the
overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest part is even and is not overlined. In
this paper, we extend the list of such congruences in two directions. First, we
prove some new individual congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$. Then, we
provide a number of infinite families of Ramanujan-like congruences satisfied
by $\overline{spt2}(n)$.

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, and $P \in
E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ be an $\F_p$-rational point. We obtain nontrivial estimates
for multiplicative character sums associated with the division polynomials
$\psi_n(P)$ twisted by several multiplicative functions, where $\psi_n(P)$
denotes the $n$-th division polynomial evaluated at $P$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two
or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve
studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical
setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the
extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward
one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate
biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we
extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races)
and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they
tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result
is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2),
generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way
expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the
same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing
completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3
this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We
also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove
density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different
behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4. and showed
that its magnitude governs the bias: 2 ) converges to the extreme values 1 or
0. $\bullet$ Moderate bias. Under additional hypotheses (automatically
satisfied in the abelian case), if L/K (C 1 , C 2 ) $\rightarrow$ 1/2,
mirroring the classical prime-ideal race studied by Rubinstein-Sarnak and
Fiorilli-Martin. Applying this criterion to several explicit families such that
the degree grows to $\infty$, Fiorilli and Jouve produced examples of both
moderate and extreme biases along families of number fields. In the same
spirit, Bailleul [1] investigated dihedral and quaternion extensions,
uncovering further families in which the densities not only approach the value
1/2 but can again be made to lie arbitrarily near the extremes, while also
highlighting the influence of central zeros of Artin L-functions on the
behavior of those densities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we use the Thue-Morse sequence and the paperfolding sequence
to build a Dirichlet series that evaluates to a linear combination of the
Riemann zeta function at odd positive integers and odd powers of $\pi$. In
doing so, we also provide an alternative proof of a 2015 result by Allouche and
Sondow.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study tensor powers of representations of finite monoids, focusing on the
growth behavior of their composition length and the number of indecomposable
summands. Special attention is given to diagram monoids such as the
Temperley-Lieb, Motzkin, and Brauer monoids. For these examples, we compute
explicit data, including some character tables, and analyze patterns in the
decomposition of their tensor powers.

Motivation: 本文旨在对多重虚辫群和多重焊合辫群的代数性质进行分类和构造，扩展已知的RLB表示，为构造非局部表示打下基础。

Method: 文章使用线性代数方法对群的同态进行了分类，并构造特定的多项式表示方法来处理非局部表示的问题。

Result: 对于多重虚辫群，得到恰好 $2^{k+1}+1$ 种不同类型的表示，除了三种外其他都不可信；对于多重焊合辫群，得到 $3 · 2^{k-1} +1$ 个表示，并构建了一个非局部表示扩展了LKB表示。

Conclusion: 研究为多重虚辫群和焊合辫群的表示理论做出了贡献，并提出了构建一般非局部表示的新路径。

Abstract: This paper classifies complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of the
multiple virtual braid group $M_kVB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for
$n\geq3$ and $k >1$, showing that such representations fall into exactly
$2^{k+1}+1$ distinct types, out of which except three all are unfaithful. In
addition, this paper investigates complex homogeneous $2$-local representations
of the multiple welded braid group $M_kWB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$
for $n\geq3$ and $k >1$, identifying $3 \cdot 2^{k-1} +1$ representations.
Moreover, the article includes a construction of a non-local representation of
$M_2WB_3$ that extends the known LKB representation of the braid group on $3$
strands, namely $B_3$, making a path towards constructing non-local
representations of $M_kWB_n$ in general.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a finite central extension $\tilde{G}$ of a classical $p$-adic reductive
group, we consider the endomorphism algebra of some induced projective
generator \`a la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of
$\tilde{G}$. In the case where the Levi subgroups decompose, we can compute
this algebra to get a result similar to the one previously obtained by the
first author for classical $p$-adic groups, showing that this intertwining
algebra is a twisted semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with
parameters by a twisted finite group algebra. We discuss also the general case.
We give then an application to the category of genuine representations of a
$p$-adic metaplectic group. Using results of C. M\oe glin relative to the Howe
correspondence, we show that the Bernstein components of these groups are
equivalent to tensor products of categories of unipotent representations of
classical groups. This generalizes a previous result of the first author. It
implies an equivalence of categories between the category of genuine
representations of the $p$-adic metaplectic group and the direct sums of those
of smooth representations of the corresponding odd special orthogonal group and
its pure inner form.
