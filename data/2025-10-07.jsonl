The $k$-rank moments are\nthen expressed as partition traces of these functions. We explore the modular\nproperties of this new family, give recursive formulas for them involving\ndivisor like sums, and prove that their Fourier coefficient are integral.\nFurthermore, we show that these functions lie in an algebra that is generated\nonly by derivatives up to a finite order but is nevertheless closed under\ndifferentiation. In the process, we also answer a question raised by Bringmann,\nPandey and van Ittersum by showing that the divisor like sum\n$$\\left(1-2^{\\ell-1} \\right) \\frac{B_\\ell}{2\\ell}+ \\sum_{2n-1 \\geq bm \\geq b}\n(2n-bm)^{\\ell-1} q^{mn} - \\sum_{m-1 \\geq 2bn \\geq 2b} (m-2bn)^{\\ell-1}\nq^{mn},$$ has a quasi-completion, when $b\\geq 3$ is odd."}

We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\\times n$ matrix whose\n$(i,j)$-entry is the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$).
