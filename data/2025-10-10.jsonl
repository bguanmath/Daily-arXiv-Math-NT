In\nquantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes)\nprovide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer\na geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they\nunderpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More\nrecently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field\nof scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization.\n  Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still\nunknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond\n$\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2$ and\n$\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2$ only\nsporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing\nmoment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class\nof reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J.\nLie Theory 2002).\n  This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension\nan order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with\ncertainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in\n$\\mathbb{C}^3\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^3\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability\nthose in $\\mathbb{C}^4\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^4\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes\nthe $2\\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit\nmoment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results."}

Using this description, we construct maps from the space of\nstable functions on depth-$r$ Moy-Prasad quotients to the depth-$r$ center, and\nattach depth-$r$ Deligne-Lusztig parameters to smooth irreducible\nrepresentations, with the assignment of parameters to irreducible\nrepresentations shown to be consistent with restricted Langlands parameters for\nMoy-Prasad types described Chen-Debacker-Tsai (arXiv:2509.07780). As an\napplication, we give a decomposition of the category of smooth representations\ninto a product of full subcategories indexed by restricted depth-$r$ Langlands\nparameters."}
