### [1] [Finite Langlands correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15101)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct the Langlands correspondence for connected reductive groups over
finite fields, which we call the finite Langlands correspondence. We discuss
also its relation with the categorical local Langlands correspondence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove a sharp density theorem for quadratic Waring's problem over cyclic
groups, when the number of variables is at least $5$. Also, we obtain some new
improvements on the density version of the quadratic Waring--Goldbach problem
over integers.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study five pencils of projective quartic Delsarte K3 surfaces. Over finite
fields, we give explicit formulas for the point counts of each family, written
in terms of hypergeometric sums. Over the complex numbers, we match the periods
of the corresponding family with hypergeometric differential operators and
series. We also obtain a decomposition of the $L$-function of each pencil in
terms of hypergeometric $L$-series and Dedekind zeta functions. This gives an
explicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by
each pencil.

### [4] [Integer continued fractions for complex numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15078)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a natural extension to complex numbers of the standard continued
fractions. The basic algorithm is due to Lagrange and Gauss, though it seems to
have gone mostly unnoticed as a way to create continued fractions. The new
representations are shown to be unique, and to have useful properties. They
also admit a geometric cutting sequence interpretation.

### [5] [Determining class groups as Galois modules up to equivalence for some nonabelian extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15242)
*Cornelius Greither,Takenori Kataoka*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Galois module structure of minus class groups in nonabelian CM extensions, particularly metacyclic extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in expanding the understanding of Galois module structures beyond abelian cases into nonabelian CM extensions, which present unique challenges and properties.

Method: The method involves focusing on a specific class of nonabelian metacyclic extensions, utilizing a previously introduced equivalence relation on modules to describe the structures of minus class groups comprehensively.

Result: The paper results in a complete description of the Galois modules that occur as minus class groups for a certain class of nonabelian metacyclic extensions.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the field by addressing nonabelian cases in CM extensions, thus broadening the scope of Galois module structure studies in algebraic number theory.

Abstract: In previous papers, the Galois module structure of minus class groups was
studied for abelian CM extensions. In this paper, we discuss some nonabelian
cases, focusing on metacyclic extensions. For a certain class of these, we
obtain a complete description of the Galois modules that occur as minus class
groups, modulo a certain equivalence relation on modules, which was introduced
earlier by the same authors.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Definitions of dense linear orders (with/without endpoints), separable linear
orders, complete linear orders, the countable chain condition for linear
orders, a Suslin line/Suslin tree and Suslin's problem Statement and proof of
Cantor's Theorem characterizing (Q,<) as the only countable dense linear order
without endpoints, up to isomorphism, the corollary which characterizes (R,<)
as the only separable complete dense linear order without endpoints, every
countable linear order embeds into (Q,<) (and thus, into (R,<)). Explanation of
why Suslin lines and Suslin trees are equivalent, what an Aronszjan line/tree
is, how it's a weakening of a Suslin line/tree. History and independence of
Suslin's problem.

### [7] [Non-negligible summands in tensor powers of some modular representations of finite $p$-groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15730)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $p>0$ be a prime, $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $\Bbbk$ be an
algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. Dave Benson has conjectured
that if $p=2$ and $V$ is an odd-dimensional indecomposable representation of
$G$ then all summands of the tensor product $V \otimes V^*$ except for $\Bbbk$
have even dimension. It is known that the analogous result for general $p$ is
false. In this paper, we investigate the class of graded representations $V$
which have dimension coprime to $p$ and for which $V \otimes V^*$ has a
non-trivial summand of dimension coprime to $p$, for a graded group scheme
closely related to $\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p^s
\mathbb{Z}$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $p>2$. We produce
an infinite family of such representations in characteristic 3 and show in
particular that the tensor subcategory generated by any of these
representations in the semisimplification contains the modulo $3$ reduction of
the category of representations of the symmetric group $S_3$. Our results are
compatible with a general version of Benson's conjecture due to Etingof.
