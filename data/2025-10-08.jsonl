For general surfaces, the categories\nare constructed via gluing along a perverse schober, categorifying the\namalgamation of cluster varieties. The case $I=A_1$ was subject of the prequel\npaper. We show that the cosingularity category is equivalent to the\ncorresponding Higgs category and to the topological Fukaya category of the\nmarked surface valued in the $1$-Calabi--Yau cluster category of type $I$."}
