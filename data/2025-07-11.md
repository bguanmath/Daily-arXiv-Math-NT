### [1] [Asymptotic properties of zeros of Riemann zeta function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07253)

Abstract: We try to define the sequence of zeros of the Riemann zeta function by an
intrinsic property. Let $(z_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ be the sequence of nontrivial
zeros of $\zeta(s)$ with positive imaginary part. We write $z_k= 1/2+i\tau_k$
(RH says that these $\tau_k$ are all real). Then the sequence $(\tau_k)_{k\in
\mathbb{N}},$ satisfies the following asymptotic relation
\[\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\frac{2x}{x^2+\tau_k^2}\simeq
\frac12\log\frac{x}{2\pi}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{x^n},\,\,x\to +\infty\]
where $a_{2n+1}=2^{-2n-2}(8-E_{2n})$, $a_{2n}=(1-2^{-2n+1})B_{2n}/(4n).$ Are
there other sequences $(\alpha_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}},$ of real or complex
numbers enjoying this property? These problems are addressed in this note.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an equivalent formula for the higher-order derivatives used in the
study of Generalized Almost Perfect Nonlinear functions over an arbitrary
finite field of characteristic $p$. The result is obtained by counting the
number of subsets of the prime field with a fixed cardinality for which the sum
of their elements is constant. We then ask related questions regarding the
diversity of higher-order derivatives.

### [3] [Higher Hida theory for Drinfeld modular curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07423)
*Daniel Barrera Salazar,Héctor del Castillo,Giovanni Rosso*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper develops Higher Hida theory for Drinfeld modular forms' cohomology and interpolates Serre duality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of cohomological properties in the context of Drinfeld modular forms, building on Higher Hida theory by Boxer and Pilloni.

Method: Using the framework inspired by Boxer and Pilloni's Higher Hida theory, the authors construct the theory for cohomology of line bundles on Drinfeld modular curve and interpolate Serre duality.

Result: The development provides a new framework for studying cohomology of line bundles associated with Drinfeld modular forms, incorporating interpolated Serre duality.

Conclusion: This work advances the study of Drinfeld modular forms by establishing a Higher Hida theory and its duality properties, offering tools for further research in the area.

Abstract: Inspired by the construction of Higher Hida theory of Boxer and Pilloni, we
develop Higher Hida theory for the cohomology of the line bundles of Drinfeld
modular forms on the Drinfeld modular curve. We also interpolate Serre duality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $q$ be a fixed odd prime. We show that a finite subset $B$ of integers,
not containing any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power modulo
almost every prime if and only if $B$ corresponds to a blocking set (with
respect to hyperplanes) in $\mathrm{PG}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k})$. Here, $k$ is the
number of distinct prime divisors of $q$-free parts of elements of $B$. As a
consequence, the property of a subset $B$ to contain $q^{th}$ power modulo
almost every prime $p$ is invariant under geometric $q$-equivalence defined by
an element of the projective general linear group
$\mathrm{PGL}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k})$. Employing this connection between two
disparate branches of mathematics, Galois geometry and number theory, we
classify, and provide bounds on the sizes of, minimal such sets $B$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the theta lifting of type II dual pairs over a
non-Archimedean local field, by combining the homological method of
Adams--Prasad--Savin and the analytic method of Fang--Sun--Xue. We have three
main results: 1. we determine completely the big theta lift of an irreducible
representation when its Godement--Jacquet L-function is holomorphic at a
critical point; 2. we compute the big theta lift of all characters, hence
determine the space of eigendistributions on matrix spaces for all characters;
3. we show that the Weil representation is projective if and only if the dual
pair is almost in the stable range.

Abstract: We show that the mutation of $\tau$-exceptional sequences over cyclic
Nakayama algebras $\Lambda$ where all projectives have length exactly
$|\Lambda|$ respects the braid group relations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let q be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra and $\theta$ an automorphism of q
of order m. We extend $\theta$ to an automorphism of the loop algebra of q and
consider the fixed-point subalgebra $q[t,t^{-1}]^{\theta}$. Using a splitting
of $q[t,t^{-1}]^{\theta}$, we construct $\theta$-twisted Poisson-commutative
versions of the Feigin--Frenkel centre and the universal Gaudin subalgebra
introduced by Ilin and Rybnikov in 2021.
