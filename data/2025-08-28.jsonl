Here we\nimprove one of our results when $r=1$; in particular we prove (outside of\ntrivial cases) that the set of primes $Q$ such that there exists $\\beta\\in\n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $p(\\ell Q n+\\beta)\\equiv 0\\pmod \\ell$ for all $n$ has density\nzero.

The concept of good\nintegers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due\nto their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications\nin various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical\nfoundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental\nnumber-theoretic properties of good integers and present their\ncharacterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with\nwell-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their\ncomputation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good\nintegers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in\nthe characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes\nand complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples\nare provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not\nonly consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of\ngood integers in bridging number theory and coding theory."}

These multiplicities can exceed one and depend intricately on\nthe group, the space, and the representation, making exact computations often\ninfeasible. This motivates the search for bounds depending only on simple\nstructural parameters.\n  More precisely, let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean\nlocal field $F$ of odd residual characteristic, and let $\\theta$ be a rational\ninvolution with fixed-point subgroup $H = G^\\theta$. For any unramified smooth\ncharacter $\\chi$ of $H$, we show that the multiplicity\n  \\[\n  \\dim \\mathrm{Hom}_G(\\rho, C^\\infty(G/H,\\chi))\n  \\] is uniformly bounded for a broad class of irreducible admissible\nrepresentations $\\rho$ of $G$, conjecturally including all such\nrepresentations. The bound depends only on the rank of $G$ and the residue\ndegree of $F$.
