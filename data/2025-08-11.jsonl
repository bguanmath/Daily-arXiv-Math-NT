Our approach is based on an identity\nconnecting ordinary generating functions of polylogarithms to integrals\ninvolving the sine function. This method provides closed-form expressions for\nlog-sine integrals of weight up to 4 using only classical polylogarithms, while\nhigher weights require Nielsen polylogarithms. Later we generalize this\nidentity and show how it gives rise to numerous Ap\\'ery-like formulae extending\nresults of Koecher, Leshchiner and others. We also derive hyperbolic analogues\nand recover several functional equations between Nielsen polylogarithms. In the\nprocess, we derive new parametric identities similar to those given by Saha and\nSinha."}
