### [1] [Quiver varieties and root multiplicities in rank 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04804)

Abstract: Building on our previous work in rank two, we use quiver varieties to give a
combinatorial upper bound on dimensions of certain imaginary root spaces for
rank 3 symmetric Kac-Moody algebras. We describe an explicit method for
extracting combinatorics when the Dynkin diagram is bipartite (i.e. two of the
nodes are not connected). As in rank two we believe these bounds are quite
tight and we give computational evidence to this effect, although there is more
error in rank 3 than in rank 2.

Abstract: We obtain the explicit direct integral decomposition of Stein's complementary
series representations and Speh representations of
$\operatorname{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ when restricted to the subgroup
$\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$. The decomposition is a direct integral
of unitarily induced representations from a maximal parabolic subgroup of
$\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ with Levi factor $\operatorname{GL}(2n-2,
\mathbb{R})\times\operatorname{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})$, where the induction data
consists of a complementary series or Speh representation of the factor
$\operatorname{GL}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})$ with the same parameter as the one of
$\operatorname{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ and a character of $\operatorname{GL}(1,
\mathbb{R})$. These results are in line with the theory of adduced
representations.
  The main tools in the proof are two families of symmetry breaking operators
between degenerate series representations of $\operatorname{GL}(2n,
\mathbb{R})$ and $\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ whose meromorphic
properties are studied in great detail.

### [3] [Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the
higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex
multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an
algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups
of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a
geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that
it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In
addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for
both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued
periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves
with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving
symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very
general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of
matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have
complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our
motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables
us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that
the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3
marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the
theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of
modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and
single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The linearized double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{ls}$ is a well-studied
Lie algebra, which reflects the depth-graded structure of multiple zeta values.
We introduce a generalization $\mathfrak{lq}$, which is motivated from the
$\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic structure of multiple q-zeta values and multiple
Eisenstein series. Precisely, we show that $\mathfrak{lq}$ is a Lie algebra,
where the Lie bracket is related to Ecalle's ari bracket on bimoulds, and give
an embedding of $\mathfrak{ls}$ into $\mathfrak{lq}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the plane, three integer points ("fleas") are given. At every tick of
time, two of them (say, P,Q) instantly jump to two vacant points R,S, so that
PQRS is a square with that order of vertices. Description of all integers and
half-integers which occur as areas of spanned triangles turns out to be
unexpectedly intricate problem. For example, if one starts from a triple (0,0),
(2,0), (4,1), these positive integers are missed: 2*{0, 1, 4, 15, 16, 20, 79,
84, 95, 119, 156}, with no other up to 3*10^6 (and seemingly, none at all);
half-integers which are missed seem to form a 39-element set (the largest of
them being 11365/2). However, there exist certain starting setups which have an
"integrable" component as part of the answer. We demonstrate that for the
initial triple (0,0), (2,1), (3,2), the integers missed as areas are perfect
squares, and the the sporadic set {5, 29, 80, 99, 179} with no other elements
up to 3*10^6 (most likely, no other at all; all half-integers serve as areas).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence
condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}:
Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a
sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts
and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to
determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers
$n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$.
For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to
be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of
$\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a
subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7
\pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in
the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the
$3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of
appropriate cubic number fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The
Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of
rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian
varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the
phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when
there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are
interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$,
in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic
study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational
curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.
