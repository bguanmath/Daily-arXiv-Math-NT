We describe an explicit method for\nextracting combinatorics when the Dynkin diagram is bipartite (i.e. two of the\nnodes are not connected).

It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups\nof the form $\\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a\ngeometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that\nit is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In\naddition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for\nboth odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued\nperiods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves\nwith marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving\nsymmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very\ngeneral extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of\nmatrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have\ncomplex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our\nmotivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables\nus to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that\nthe motive of the moduli stack $\\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3\nmarked points is mixed Tate.\n  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the\ntheory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of\nmodular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and\nsingle-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest."}

However, there exist certain starting setups which have an\n\"integrable\" component as part of the answer.
