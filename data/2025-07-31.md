### [1] [A note on multiplicative-inverse chaining in finite fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22142)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider chaining multiplicative-inverse operations in finite fields under
alternating polynomial bases. When using two distinct polynomial bases to
alternate the inverse operation we obtain a partition of $\mathbb
F_{p^n}\setminus \mathbb F_p$ into disjoint cycles of even length. This allows
a natural interpretation of the cycles as permutation cycles. Finally, we
explore chaining under more than two polynomial bases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the structure of the higher Chow groups $CH^2(E,1)$ for an
elliptic curve $E$ over a global function field $F$. Focusing on the kernel
$V(E)$ of the push-forward map $CH^2(E,1)\to F^{\times}$ associated to the
structure map $E\to \operatorname{Spec}(F)$, we analyze the torsion part $V(E)$
based on the mod $l$ Galois representations associated to the $l$-torsion
points $E[l]$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hypergeometric sequences obey first-order linear recurrence relations with
polynomial coefficients and are commonplace throughout the mathematical and
computational sciences. For certain classes of hypergeometric sequences, we
prove linear growth estimates on their Weil heights. We give an application of
our effective results towards the Membership Problem from Computer Science.
Recall that Membership asks to procedurally determine whether a specified
target is an element of a given recurrence sequence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let \( \pi \) be a polarized, regular algebraic, cuspidal automorphic
representation of \( \GL_n(\bb{A}_F) \) where \( F \) is totally real or
imaginary CM, and let \( (\rho_\lambda)_\lambda \) be its associated compatible
system of Galois representations. We prove that if \( 7\nmid n \) and \( 4
\nmid n \) then there is a Dirichlet density \( 1 \) set of rational primes \(
\mc{L} \) such that whenever \( \lambda\mid \ell \) for some \( \ell\in \mc{L}
\), then \( \rho_\lambda \) is irreducible.

### [5] [On signs of Fourier coefficients on GL(n)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22718)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study statistical properties of Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms
on GL(n). For most Hecke-Maass cusp forms, we give the asymptotic number of
nonvanishing coefficients, show that there is a positive proportion of sign
changes among them, when these are real, and describe the asymptotic density of
these signs. We generalize the results by J\"a\"asaari obtained in the case of
self-dual forms of GL(3) and our method moreover circumvents the assumption of
the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the construction of Castella and Do of an anticyclotomic Euler
system for the $p$-adic Galois representation of a modular form, using diagonal
classes. Combining this construction and some previous results of ours, we
obtain new results towards the Bloch--Kato conjecture in analytic rank one,
assuming that the fixed prime $p$ is inert in the relevant imaginary quadratic
field.

### [7] [Constructible Subcategories and Unbounded Representation Type (with an appendix by Andres Fernandez Herrero)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22192)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that bounded type implies finite type for a constructible subcategory
of the module category of a finitely generated algebra over a field, which is a
variant of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture. A full subcategory is
constructible if it consists of all modules that vanish on a finitely presented
functor. Our approach makes use of the Ziegler spectrum of a ring and a
connection, established in this work, with the scheme of finite dimensional
modules. We also discuss a variant of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture in
this setting. It is shown to be true under additional assumptions on the
algebra, but wrong in general. Lastly, it is proven that exact structures and
matrix reductions give rise to constructible subcategories. Based on this, a
translation from matrix reductions to reductions of exact structures is
provided.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Several recent problems in the representation theory of finite groups require
determining whether certain characters of almost simple groups belong to the
principal block. Since the values of these characters are not yet known, we
employ alternative group-theoretical techniques to address the "going down"
case. This approach enables us to reduce the block version of well-known
results by the third and fourth authors to a question about almost simple
groups. Moreover, this suggests a Galois analogue of the
height-zero-equal-degree conjecture of Malle and Navarro, which we formulate.
However, the "going up" case of irreducible extensions of principal block
characters remains unresolved.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A brief proof of Lie's classification of finite dimensional subalgebras of
vector fields on the complex plane that have a proper Levi decomposition is
given. The proof uses basic representation theory of sl(2, C). This, combined
with \cite{ABF2} and \cite{ABF3} completes the classification of finite
dimensional subalgebras of vector fields on the complex plane.

### [10] [Segal-Sugawara vectors for orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22738)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the centre of the affine vertex algebra at the critical level
associated with the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra. It is well-known that the
centre is a commutative superalgebra, and we construct a family of its elements
in an explicit form. In particular, this gives a new proof of the formulas for
the central elements for the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras. Our
arguments rely on the properties of a new extended Brauer-type algebra.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced
simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in
a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that
equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric
root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type.
This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple
singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root
system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a
completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form
and variation operator of the singularity theory.
