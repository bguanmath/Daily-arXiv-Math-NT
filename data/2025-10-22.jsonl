Following Lichtenbaum, the\nBernoulli--Hurwitz numbers of $E$ (i.e., values of Eisenstein series evaluated\nat $E$ up to normalization) admit integral representations given by a $p$-adic\nmeasure constructed from an elliptic function. We show that the periods of this\nmeasure are in fact special values of a family of weight one Eisenstein series\nat the CM curve $E$ equipped with certain level data, and explicitly relate it\nto Katz's one-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure, whereby we derive period\nformulas of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz measure attached to any ordinary elliptic\ncurve $\\mathcal{E}$ defined over a local field. Moreover, by exploiting the\nmodularity of these periods, and thanks to the existence of abundant weight one\nHasse-type invariants, we present a novel approach to the interpolation\nproperty of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz $p$-adic zeta functions of the ordinary\nelliptic curve $\\mathcal{E}$, and obtain a $p$-adic Kronecker's first limit\nformula."}
