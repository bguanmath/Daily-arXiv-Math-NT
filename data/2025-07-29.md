Abstract: In correspondence with Goldbach, Euler began investigating series of the form
  $\sum_{k \geq 1} k^{-m}\left(1 + 2^{-n} + \cdots + k^{-n}\right)$, which are
known today as Euler sums. For the case where $n=1$ and $m \geq 2$, Euler was
able to obtain a closed form in terms of zeta values. We use elementary
techniques in the spirit of Euler to evaluate the series $\sum_{k \geq 1}
\frac{H_k H_{k+1} H_{k+2} H_{k+3}}{k(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)},$ where $H_k := 1 +
\frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k}$ is the $k$th harmonic number, in terms of
zeta values. The closed form is a potential counterexample to a conjecture of
Furdui and S\^int\u{a}m\u{a}rian. We relate this problem to conjectures
regarding irrationality and $\mathbb{Q}$-linear independence of zeta values.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a study of the problem of finiteness of the $\beta$-expansions for
the set of natural numbers, condition $F_1$ in brief, for three families of
Pisot numbers for which the $\beta$-expansion of 1 is not a non-decreasing
sequence. We show a class of simple $\beta$-numbers which display a puzzling
behaviour, in the sense that an infinite subset of such $\beta$ satisfy $F_1$,
whereas a complementary infinite subset does not. This puzzle is organized by
the residue class modulo 3 of an integer coefficient of the main family of
polynomials discussed. We prove that, when $F_1$ does not hold, the complement
of ${{\rm Fin}(\beta)}$ is infinite. Finally, we give a concise sufficient
condition for $F_1$, which is the finitude of the $\beta$-expansion of
$(\beta-\lfloor \beta\rfloor)^2$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The isogeny cutoff of a $p$-divisible group $X$ (defined over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$) measures the amount of
$p$-torsion necessary to determine its isogeny class. The minimal height of $X$
measures its distance to the closest minimal $p$-divisible group (in the sense
of Oort). In this paper, we study these invariants for supersingular unitary
$p$-divisible groups of signature $(a,b)$. We provide a complete description of
the possible minimal heights. As an application, we establish bounds on the
isogeny cutoffs for these $p$-divisible groups. Finally, we rephrase our
results in the language of the $\mathrm{BT}_m$ stratifications of unitary
Shimura varieties of signature $(a,b)$.

Abstract: We introduce a kind of finite truncation of the hypergeometric series and
provide its discretized integral representation. This is motivated by recent
results of Maesaka-Seki-Watanabe and Hirose-Matsusaka-Seki on the identity
between truncated series and discretized integrals which comes from the
mutliple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms. We also prove the formula of
Ohno-Zagier type which relates the truncated multiple polylogarithms and the
truncated hypergeometric series.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent work, the author, in collaboration with Allen, Long, and Tu,
developed the Explicit Hypergeometric Modularity Method (EHMM), which
establishes the modularity of a large class of hypergeometric Galois
representations in dimensions two and three. One important application of the
EHMM is the construction of an explicit family of eta-quotients, which we call
the $\mathbb{K}_{2}$ functions, from the hypergeometric background. In this
article, we introduce an analogous family of eta-quotients, which we call the
$\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions. These $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions are constructed
using the theory of weight one cubic theta functions originally developed by
Jonathan and Peter Borwein. We then use the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions in the
EHMM to resolve several hypergeometric modularity conjectures of Dawsey and
McCarthy. Further, we provide applications to special $L$-values of the
$\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions and to the study of generalized Paley graphs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For a non-zero algebraic number $\alpha$ of degree $d$, let $h(\alpha)$
denote its logarithmic Weil height. It is known that when $h(\alpha)$ is small,
and $d$ is large, the conjugates of $\alpha$ are clustered near the unit circle
and have angular equidistribution in the complex plane about the origin. In
this paper, we establish a $p$-adic analogue of this result by obtaining lower
bounds for $h(\alpha)$ in terms of the number of its conjugates that lie in a
finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, for some prime $p$. As a consequence, we
prove Lehmer's conjecture for all $\alpha$ such that $\gg \sqrt{d\log d}$ many
of its conjugates lie in a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

Conclusion: 通过新类比视角，论文成功解决了一个数论域上猜想的特定情况，为未来的相关研究提供了新工具和方法。

Abstract: In the present paper, we provide a new analogy between number fields and
1-dimensional function fields over finite fields from the viewpoint that the
maximal cyclotomic extension of a number field is analogous to the constant
field extension of a function field to an algebraic closure. Namely, we give a
number field analogue of the Grothendieck conjecture for hyperbolic curves over
finite fields proved by Tamagawa and Mochizuki, which is an affirmative answer
to Conjecture(12.5.3) of ``Cohomology of number fields" by
Neukirch-Schmidt-Wingberg in the case where the ramified prime sets are empty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过研究退化Sheffer型多项式这一混合体，可以更深入理解和解析高阶退化Bernoulli和Euler多项式之间的关系以及它们的共性，从而拓展多项式理论的应用领域。

Method: 首先，作者引入退化Sheffer型多项式并推导其属性。其次，在假定随机变量Y的矩生成函数在原点邻域存在的情况下，进一步探讨此类多项式的一般属性及其在均匀和伯努利随机变量特定情况下的表现。

Result: 1. 得到了退化Sheffer型多项式的基本属性。
2. 分析了其包括与随机变量Y关联时的生成函数等属性的详细推导。
3. 在均匀和伯努利随机变量的特定情形下，得出更多相关的具体属性和结果。
4. 提出了关于高阶退化Bernoulli和Euler多项式的新研究发现。

Conclusion: 该论文介绍了退化Sheffer型多项式，并研究了它们的属性及其与随机变量Y的关系，同时也探讨了特定情况下对此类多项式的表现，并最终为高阶退化Bernoulli和Euler多项式提供了新的理论结果。

Abstract: This paper has two primary contributions. First, we explore degenerate
Sheffer-type polynomials, a hybrid of higher-order degenerate Bernoulli and
Euler polynomials, and derive their properties. Second, assuming that the
moment generating function of Y exists in a neighborhood of the origin, we
introduce the degenerate Sheffer polynomials associated with Y. We then
investigate their properties in general and for the specific cases of uniform
and Bernoulli random variables. We also present new results for the
higher-order degenerate Bernoulli and Euler polynomials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决Wang和Zeng在部分Nahm和的模性问题中发现的剩余两个无限乘积的模性证明。

Method: 论文分两步进行。第一步，利用涉及两个Bailey对的变换公式，将部分Nahm和转化为特定的Hecke型级数；第二步，采用两种不同方法，将Hecke型级数转换为所需的模无穷乘积。

Result: 成功证明了剩余家族中的两个Rogers-Ramanujan类型等式，验证了相关部分Nahm和的模性。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解和应用部分Nahm和的模现象及其在数学中的意义提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recently, Wang and Zeng investigated modularity of partial Nahm sums and
discovered 14 modular families of such sums. They confirmed modularity for 13
families and proposed a conjecture consisting of two Rogers--Ramanujan type
identities for the remaining family. We prove these conjectural identities in
two steps. First, employing a transformation formula involving two Bailey
pairs, we transform the partial Nahm sums into some specific Hecke-type series.
Second, using two distinct approaches, we convert these Hecke-type series to
the desired modular infinite products.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish a one-sided central limit theorem for the logarithms of
regulators of a fixed rational non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over imaginary
quadratic fields of rank one, motivated by the Gross--Zagier formula and a
result of Radziwi\l\l and Soundararajan.
  We also establish the existence of many imaginary quadratic fields whose
regulators grow at least as fast as the square root of the conductor of the
field.
  When the central value of the $L$-function of $E$ is non-vanishing, these
results also hold for the regulator of the quadratic twist $E^{(d)}$ over
$\mathbb{Q}$.
  Moreover, assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, we obtain the
uniform boundedness of the Shafarevich--Tate groups and Tamagawa numbers for
these rank-one quadratic twists.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $A(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n q^n$ and $B(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n q^n$
be two eta quotients. Previously, we considered the problem of when \[ a_n=0
<=> b_n=0. \] Here we consider the ``mod $m$'' version of this problem, i.e.
eta quotients $A(q)$ and $B(q)$ and integers $m>1$ such that \[ a_n \equiv 0
\pmod m <=> b_n \equiv 0 \pmod m? \] We found results for $m=p^2$, $p=2, 3$ and
$5$. For $m=4,9$, we found results which apply to infinite families of eta
quotients. For example: Let $A(q)$ have the form \begin{equation} A(q) =
f_1^{3j_1+1}\prod_{3\nmid i}f_i^{3j_i}\prod_{3|i}f_i^{j_i} =:
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nq^n,\,\,B(q) = \frac{f_3}{f_1^3}A(q) =:
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_nq^n \end{equation} with
$f_{k}=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{kn})$. Then \begin{align*}
a_{3n}-b_{3n}&\equiv 0\pmod 9,\\ 2a_{3n+1}+b_{3n+1}&\equiv0\pmod 9,\\
a_{3n+2}+2b_{3n+2}&\equiv0\pmod 9. \end{align*} Some of these theorems also had
some combinatorial implications, such as the following: Let $p_2^{(3)}(n)$
denote the number of bipartitions $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$ of $n$ where $\pi_1$ is
3-regular. Then \begin{equation*} p_2^{(3)}(n)\equiv0\pmod 9 <=> n\text{ is not
a generalized pentagonal number}. \end{equation*} In the case of $m=25$, we do
not have any general theorems that apply to an infinite family of eta
quotients. Instead we give two tables of results that appear to hold
experimentally. We do prove some individual results (using theory of modular
forms), such as the following: Let the sequences $\{c_n\}$ and $\{d_n\}$ be
defined by \begin{equation*} f_1^{10}=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nq^n, \hspace{25pt}
f_1^{5}f_5=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}d_nq^n. \end{equation*} Then \begin{equation*}
c_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25} <=> d_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25}. \end{equation*}

Result: The paper presents refined results on the structure of fine and plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups. It proves several new theorems, particularly offering stronger conclusions when the base field is $\mathbb{Q}$.

Conclusion: The study reveals enhanced structural insights into fine and plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups in cyclotomic extensions, advancing the theoretical framework and providing a solid basis for future research in this field.

Abstract: In this article we study the algebraic structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups

Main category: math.NT

Method: 定义了一个新的多项式序列${\left(B_{n , q}(X)\right)}_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0} $，通过Jackson积分进行了定义，并探索与Carlitz的q-Bernoulli多项式和数的联系。

Result: 我们证明了数$ B_{n , q}(0) $恰好是Carlitz q-Bernoulli数，以及多项式$ B_{n , q}(X) $是经典Bernoulli多项式的q类比，并提供了这种q类比的新观点。

Conclusion: 通过使用Jackson积分，我们重新表述了Carlitz q-Bernoulli数，并且展示所定义的新类比与其具有实质联系，提供了对q-Bernoulli多项式和数的新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates $q$-analogues of the classical Bernoulli polynomials
and numbers. We introduce a new polynomial sequence ${\left(B_{n ,
q}(X)\right)}_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}$, defined via the Jackson integral, and
explore its connections with Carlitz's $q$-Bernoulli polynomials and numbers.
Specifically, we prove that the numbers $B_{n , q}(0)$ are exactly the Carlitz
$q$-Bernoulli numbers and that the polynomials $B_{n , q}(X)$ are genuine
$q$-analogues of the classical Bernoulli polynomials. This approach leverages
the Jackson integral to reformulate Carlitz's $q$-Bernoulli numbers in terms of
classical polynomial structures, offering new insights into their properties.

Abstract: For an irrational number $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ we consider its irrationality
measure function $$ \psi_\alpha(t) = \min_{1\le q\le t,\, q\in\mathbb{Z}} \|
q\alpha \|. $$ Let $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ be
$n$-tuple of pairwise independent irrational numbers. For each $t \in
\mathbb{R}_{>1}$ irrationality measure functions $\psi_{\alpha_1}, \dots,
\psi_{\alpha_n}$ can be written in an increasing order $$\psi_{\alpha_{v_1}}(t)
> \psi_{\alpha_{v_2}}(t) > \dots > \psi_{\alpha_{v_{n-1}}}(t) >
\psi_{\alpha_{v_n}}(t).$$ We consider the vector of functions
$\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t): \mathbb{R}_{>1} \rightarrow S_n$
associated to this order and defined as
$$\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t) = ( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{n-1}, v_n
).$$ Let $\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ be the number of infinitely
occurring different values of $\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t)$. It is
known that if $\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})= k$ we have $ n \leq
\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.$ At the same time, for $k \geq 3$ and $n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$
there exists an $n$-tuple $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ with
$\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = k$. In this work we define a $k$-cyclic
permutation $\pi$ and prove that in the extremal case $n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}, \
\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = k$ the set of successive values of
$\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t)$ is an orbit of $\pi$.

### [17] [On the Algebraic Independence of $E$- and $G$-Functions, II: An Effective Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20429)
*Daniel Vargas-Montoya*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper studies the algebraic independence of E- and G-functions in a set MF(K) of power series over a totally ramified finite extension of Q_p, providing a criterion for determining their independence and demonstrating it with examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algebraic independence is a central topic in number theory and transcendental number theory in particular. E- and G-functions are important classes of functions in this context, but understanding when their elements are algebraically independent is challenging. This paper aims to provide a practical criterion for assessing algebraic independence in this important class of functions.

Method: The authors define a set MF(K) as solutions of differential operators in K(z)[d/dz] with strong Frobenius structure and satisfying the MOM condition at zero. They then develop a criterion based on the analytic properties of these power series to determine algebraic independence over the field of analytic elements.

Result: The paper establishes a criterion for the algebraic independence of elements in MF(K) and demonstrates its effectiveness by proving the algebraic independence of certain E- and G-functions using this criterion.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable tool for analyzing the algebraic independence of E- and G-functions through the characterization of their differential properties in the MF(K) framework. The provided criterion opens new avenues for research in transcendental number theory.

Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ that is totally ramified over
$\mathbb{Q}_p$. The set $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}(K)$ consists of power series in
$1+zK[[z]]$ that are solutions of differential operators in $K(z)[d/dz]$
equipped with strong Frobenius structure and satisfying maximal order
multiplicty (MOM) condition at zero. It turns out that this set contains an
interesting class of $E$- and $G$-functions. In this work, we provide a
criterion for determining the algebraic independence, over the field of
analytic elements, of elements belonging to $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}(K)$. As an
illustration of this criterion, we show the algebraic independence of some $E$-
and $G$-functions over the field of analytic elements.

Method: 作者借鉴模形式相关的l-进Galois表示理论，推出两作者与Craig提出的显式描述...的猜想的新证明，不同于Kane等人所用的解析方法。这种数学方法为处理数论问题提供了独特的工具。.

Conclusion: 研究将利用模形式的Galois表示理论应用于McMahon分拆函数，为理解素数提供新方法。这种方法不仅强化了数论基础，还可能推动其他数学领域的发展。

Abstract: MacMahon's partition functions and their extensions provide equations that
identify prime numbers as solutions. These results depend on the theory of
(mixed weight) quasimodular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Two of the authors,
along with Craig, conjectured an explicit description of the set of
prime-detecting quasimodular forms in terms of Eisenstein series and their
derivatives. Kane et al.\ recently verified this conjecture using analytic
methods. We offer an alternative proof using the theory of $\ell$-adic Galois
representations associated to modular forms.

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{R}^m$ be endowed with the Euclidean metric. The covering radius
of a lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the least distance $r$ such
that, given any point of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the distance from that point to
$\Lambda$ is not more than $r$. Lattices can occur via the unit group of the
ring of integers in an algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}$, by applying a
logarithmic embedding $\mathbb{K}^*\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. In this paper, we
examine those lattices which arise from the cyclotomic number field
$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$, for a given positive integer $n\geq5$ such that $n\not
\equiv 2\pmod{4}$. We then provide improvements to an upper bound in (de
Araujo, 2024), and conclude with an upper bound on the covering radius for this
lattice in terms of $n$ and the number of its distinct prime factors. In
particular, we improve Lemma 2 of (de Araujo, 2024) and show that,
asymptotically, it can be improved no further.

Abstract: Given a field $\mathbb{F}$, we introduce a novel group $SD(\mathbb{F})$ of

\mathbb{F}$ to the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) +
f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$. We compute this group

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to solve Hypothesis H for GLn over number fields which had prior results limited to n≤4 due to the functoriality barrier. The authors aim to provide more effective and precise results.

Method: The authors prove this using a new analytic method that includes a power sieve over number fields and an iterative argument to circumvent the limitations of the previous methodology.

Result: The results include the proof of Hypothesis H in full generality and the unconditional establishment of GUE statistics for automorphic L-function zeros, the first effective polynomial bound for the strong multiplicity one problem, and resolution of the Selberg orthogonality conjecture with stronger error terms.

Conclusion: This paper presents a significant breakthrough in the field by resolving major conjectures and providing key results across a variety of applications, all with improved effective bounds and overcoming a prior limitation of the field's methodology.

Abstract: We prove Hypothesis H in full generality for ${\rm GL}_n$ over any number
field. This result is a consequence of our stronger effective bound on Euler
products involving Rankin--Selberg coefficients at prime ideal powers. The
proof rests on a new analytic method, which employs a power sieve over number
fields and an iterative argument to bypass the functoriality barrier that had
restricted prior results to $n\leq 4$. As applications, we unconditionally
establish the GUE statistics for automorphic $L$-function zeros, provide the
first effective polynomial bound for the strong multiplicity one problem for
coefficients, and resolve the Selberg orthogonality conjecture with stronger
error terms.

Abstract: We say that two elliptic curves $E$ and $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ are congruent
modulo a prime $p$ if their $p$-torsion Galois modules (over the algebraic
closure of $\mathbb{Q}$) are isomorphic. Such a congruence is called trivial if
there is a rational isogeny between $E$ and $F$ with degree prime to $p$. A
version of the Frey-Mazur conjecture states that any congruence modulo any
prime $p \geq 19$ is trivial. Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a
prime $p$, it is well-known that there is a twist of the classical modular
curve $X(p)$ whose rational points describe the elliptic curves congruent to
$E$ modulo $p$. In this article, we apply Mazur's strategy to determine the
rational points of such a twisted modular curve under certain assumptions. In
particular, we determine an explicit bound on the conductor of any elliptic
curve congruent modulo $p$ to $y^2=x^3-p$ when $p$ is prime and congruent to
$5$ modulo $9$, and deduce that any congruence modulo $23$ to $y^2=x^3-23$ is
trivial.

Motivation: 希望通過廣義Tate模的構造來建立一個兼容的Weil群表示系統，特別是在全局函數域F的情境下研究Anderson A-動機的表示理論

Method: 作者將Tate模的構造推廣為一種張量函子，應用於$F_\mathfrak{p}$-isocrystals，即使它們不一定是純的，并通過證明該函子在M的約化下的行為來達成目標

Result: 作者成功將Galois表示的兼容系統擴展為與每個F位置相關的Weil群表示，並相容全局函數場F的情境

Conclusion: 開發出了一種全新的$\wp$-adic Weil表示，這些表示與特殊特徵$\wp$的Drinfeld模相關，解決了純$F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals的情況並延伸到非純的案例

Abstract: Every Anderson $A$-motive $M$ over a field determines a compatible system of
Galois representations on its Tate modules at almost all primes of $A$. This
adapts easily to $F$-isocrystals, which are rational analogues of $A$-motives
for the global function field $F:=\operatorname{Quot}(A)$. We extend this
compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$
for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction
to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily
pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that
construction behaves under reduction of $M$. As an offshoot we obtain a new
kind of $\wp$-adic Weil representations associated to Drinfeld modules of
special characteristic $\wp$.

Abstract: We prove that if all the simple groups involved in a finite group $G$ satisfy

*Shantanu Sardar,Alfredo Gonzalez Chaio,Sonia Trepode*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper studies finite cyclic group actions on finite-dimensional path algebras, generating Galois semi-covering functors that promote to coverings under free actions. They contribute to the representation theory of skew group algebras by characterizing irreducible morphisms and almost split sequences, and preserving stable ranks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding group actions on path algebras and their impact on module categories and representation theory, particularly in identifying preserved algebraic properties under skew group constructions.

Method: The method involves constructing a Galois semi-covering functor from G to its covering space, analyzing module behavior under this construction, leveraging homological algebra, and generalizing results for free and non-free group actions when specific conditions are met.

Result: Key results include the existence and classification of Galois semi-covering functors under specified conditions, characterizing irreducible morphisms and almost split sequences in skew group algebras, and preserving (stable) rank properties, specifically applying these to skew-gentle algebras.

Conclusion: The study establishes significant connections between group actions on path algebras and their representation-theoretic properties, enabling the preservation of stable rank and the detailed understanding of irreducible maps and almost split sequences in skew contexts.

Abstract: For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of
K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional path algebra KQ of a quiver Q.
Under certain assumptions on the action of G, we show the existence of a
certain kind of covering that we call a Galois semi-covering functor, which
becomes a Galois covering when the group action is free. We study the module
category of its skew group algebra under this functor. As an application, we
obtain a complete description of the irreducible morphisms and almost split
sequences of skew group algebras and show that the (stable) rank is preserved
under skewness. In particular, we determine the stable rank of skew-gentle
algebras.

Motivation: Alperin 权重猜想是模表示论中的一个核心问题，文章的动机在于从函子等价角度（尤其是在特征 0 和特征 p 域上的等价块）研究这一猜想，并验证其在稳定条件下的有效性。

Method: 研究基于 (stable) 函子等价的块结构，提出了 Alperin 块权重猜想的函子版本，并且通过函子范畴的比较方法，在特征 0 上证明了该版本成立。

Result: 1. 提出了一个 Alperin 块权重猜想的函子等价版本。2. 证明该函子等价版本与原 Alperin 猜想等价。3. 展示该猜想在特征 0 上成立的稳定性质。

Conclusion: 该文工作将 Alperin 权重猜想推广到一个更稳定的函子等价形式，并为理解该猜想在不同特征域上的关系提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$ and
let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We
consider Alperin's weight conjecture (over $k$) from the point of view of
(stable) functorial equivalence of blocks over $\mathbb{F}$. We formulate a
functorial version of Alperin's blockwise weight conjecture, and show that it
is equivalent to the original one. We also show that this conjecture holds
stably, i.e., in the category of stable diagonal $p$-permutation functors over
$\mathbb{F}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical simple Lie algebra over an algebraically
closed field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero or large enough, and let
$\mathfrak n$ be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The main tool
in representation theory of $\mathfrak n$ is the orbit method, which classifies
primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathfrak n)$ and
unitary representations of the unipotent group $N=\exp(\mathfrak n)$ in terms
of coadjoint orbits on the dual space $\mathfrak n^*$. In the paper, we
describe explicitly coadjoint orbits of low dimension for $\mathfrak n$ as
above. The answer is given in terms of subsets of positive roots. As a
corollary, we provide a way to calculate the number of irreducible complex
representations of dimensions $q$, $q^2$ and $q^3$ for a maximal unipotent
subgroup $N(q)$ in a classical Chevalley group $G(q)$ over a finite field
$\mathbb F_q$ with $q$ elements. It turned out that this number is a polynomial
in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, which agrees with Isaac's
conjecture.

automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces
we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dealing with the decomposition of multi-parameter quiver representations which are more complicated and difficult to decompose than Type An quivers

Method: establishes a filtration based on the nature of quivers and offers a framework to restrict to subcategories with computational intimacy

Result: develops a theoretical basis for subcategories of quiver representations which are with manageable complexity and can be meaningfully distinguished through computational means

Conclusion: proposes a framework to tackle multi-parameter persistences by focusing on well-structured, computable subcategories of quiver representations and theoretical results for distinction among objects.

Abstract: When filtering a topological space by a single parameter, the theory of
quiver representations provides a complete framework for decomposing the
resulting persistence module to obtain its barcode. This is achieved by
interpreting the persistence module as a representation of a Type
$\mathbb{A}_n$ quiver. The complexity increases significantly when filtering by
two or more parameters. In particular, multi-parameter persistence typically
yields tame or wild type quivers whose indecomposable representations are more
complicated to describe and for which arbitrary representations are much more
difficult to decompose. The theme of this work is to provide a framework for
restricting to subcategories of quiver representations whose objects can be
distinguished from one another through computational means.

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category, $\mathfrak{A}$ be a precosheaf of
unital $k$-algebras on $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathfrak{M}$ be an
$\mathfrak{A}$-bimodule. We introduce two new notions, namely, the Grothendieck
construction $Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{M})$ of $\mathfrak{A}$
and $\mathfrak{M}$, as well as the extension category algebra $\mathfrak{A}
\ltimes \mathfrak{M}$. The extension category algebra contains the trivial
extension algebra and the skew category algebra as special cases. If
$\mathcal{C}$ is object-finite, we prove that the category of modules of
$Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{M})$ is equivalent to the category of
modules over $\mathfrak{A} \ltimes \mathfrak{M}$. Finally, we obtain two
LHS-spectral sequences about $Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{N})$ for
a right $\mathfrak{A}$-module $\mathfrak{N}$.
