However, in the setting of\ndynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply\neffectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\\limsup$ sets\ngenerally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.\n  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that\nenables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target\nproblems, particularly for the $\\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map.\nMoreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\\limsup$ sets have large\nintersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is\nthat, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding\nan appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between\nthermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e22\u756a\u56fe\u903c\u8fd1\u4e2dlimsup\u96c6\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8be5\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5173\u4e8e\u6536\u7f29\u9776\u6807\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u03b2\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5173limsup\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e22\u756a\u56fe\u903c\u8fd1\u4e4b\u95f4\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e22\u756a\u56fe\u903c\u8fd1\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Hausdorff\u7ef4\u6570\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e22\u756a\u56fe\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49limsup\u96c6\u7684\u7403\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u70b9x\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u5931\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bf8\u5982\u6536\u7f29\u9776\u6807\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3001\u5176\u534a\u5f84\u52a8\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Gibbs\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u5ff5, \u4ee5\u63a2\u7a76\u70b9\u96c6\u5728\u8be5\u52a8\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8986\u76d6\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u5176\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u03b2\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176limsup\u96c6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u903c\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e22\u756a\u56fe\u903c\u8fd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4e3a\u6536\u7f29\u9776\u6807\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u8d4b\u4e88\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We prove graph structural\ntheorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism\nring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic\nperspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied\non restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication,\nordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In\nparticular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny\nclasses. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the\nlattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \\'etale\nalgebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful\nstudy of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of\nvolcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to\nour more general setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
