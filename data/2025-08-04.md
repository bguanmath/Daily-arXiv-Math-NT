### [1] [Some conjectures on the quotients of the tensor products in the category $\mathscr{X}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00488)

Abstract: Let ${\bf G}$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over the
finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. We propose some conjectures
concerning the simple quotients of $M\otimes N$, where $M,N$ are objects in the
representation category $\mathscr{X}({\bf G})$. We provide several pieces of
evidence for these conjectures. In particular, we show that these conjectures
are valid for ${\bf G}=SL_2(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q)$.

Abstract: We introduce algebraic families of Dirac operators for the deformation family
(and other related families) associated with a real reductive Lie group that
interpolates the reductive group and the corresponding Cartan motion group. We
prove Vogan's conjecture in this setting, relating the infinitesimal character
of an algebraic family of Harish-Chandra modules and its Dirac cohomology.

Abstract: We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra
satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and
acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We
introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally
A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a
quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of
the quiver does not.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the groups $G_2$ and $G_3$ associated to the $2
\times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ Rubik's cubes. We express $G_2$ and $G_3$ in terms
of familiar groups and exhibit a split homomorphism $\psi: G_3 \longrightarrow
G_2$ to prove that $G_2$ embeds inside $G_3$ as a subgroup. In addition, we
prove several results bounding the dimensions of minimal faithful
representations of finite abelian groups split by some complementary subgroup.
We then employ these results to determine the minimal faithful dimensions of
$G_2$ and $G_3$ over both $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. We find that $G_2$ has
minimal dimension 8 over $\mathbb{C}$ and 16 over $\mathbb{R}$, and that $G_3$
has minimal dimension 20 over $\mathbb{C}$ and 28 over $\mathbb{R}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let K be a number field and let f(x) = x^q + c where q is a prime power, c is
in K, and f is not post-critically finite. We show that for any strictly
preperiodic b in K, the iterated Galois group at b with respect to f has finite
index in the generic iterated Galois group for f.

### [6] [Streamlined WZ method proofs of Van Hamme supercongruences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00343)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Using the WZ method to prove supercongruences critically depends on an
inspired WZ pair choice. This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ
pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are
thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $\Gamma_p$ by
Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences
B.2, C.2, D.2, E.2, F.2, G.2, and H.2. This approach also yields the known
extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo
$4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence I.2 is shown to be a special case
of the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds.

### [8] [A New Class of Linear Relations for Scalar Partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00677)
*Boris Y. Rubinstein*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: A problem asking for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation. A paper presents an algorithm to derive linear relations for scalar partitions, using Cayley's theorem to reduce double partitions. This involves a variable elimination approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to provide a method for deriving linear relations in scalar integer partition problems. Current approaches may not systematically address such relations, especially when dealing with a finite number of partitions and complex elimination procedures. This work aims to enhance computational methods by leveraging Cayley's theorem for variable elimination.

Method: The algorithm utilizes Cayley's theorem for variable elimination, transforming double partitions into a sum of scalar partitions. By applying the variable elimination procedure, the method iteratively derives linear relations between subsets of scalar partitions, enhancing the ability to handle finite partition sets.

Result: The paper produces an algorithm that effectively translates the problem of double partitions into sums of scalar partitions. The algorithm is designed to correctly eliminate variables and derive accurate linear relations, as demonstrated through specific instances provided in the manuscript.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm, based on Cayley's theorem, is a valid method for deriving linear relations in scalar integer partitions, particularly for reducing double partitions to scalar ones using variable elimination. This contributes to the field by enhancing the computation of such relations.

Abstract: A scalar integer partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer
solutions to a linear Diophantine equation with integer positive coefficients.
The manuscript discusses an algorithm of derivation of linear relations
involving the finite number of scalar partitions. The algorithm employs the
Cayley theorem about the reduction of a double partition to a sum of scalar
partitions based on the variable elimination procedure.
