Building upon foundational work by\nGandhi (1971), Golomb (1976), and Keller (2007), we establish the effective\nbound $s_n \\le 2p_n$ for all $n \\ge 1$ within the Golomb-Keller analytic\nrecurrence. This transforms their asymptotic formula into an explicit\nrecurrence using twice the n-th prime as the exponent: $$ p_{n+1} = \\left\\lceil\n\\left( -1 + \\zeta(2p_n) \\prod_{j=1}^{n} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_j^{2p_n}}\\right)\n\\right)^{-1/(2p_n)} \\right\\rceil $$ The proof is self-contained and relies on\nBertrand's postulate.
