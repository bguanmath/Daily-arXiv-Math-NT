Abstract: It has been known for a long time that Ext's between IC-sheaves may often be
expressed in terms of Hom's between cohomology groups. We prove a more general
result under weaker assumptions. The result is used to describe the action of
the derived Satake equivalence on !-pure objects and show that the equivalence
enjoys a new kind of functoriality with respect to morphisms of reductive
groups. We find and prove normality of the symplectic dual X^! for many smooth
affine Hamiltonian G-varieties X, including X=T^*(G/H) for all connected
reductive subgroups H of G. We also describe the symplectic duals M^! in the
case of Coulomb branches and prove that M^! has symplectic singularities.

### [2] [One algebra of double cosets for a general linear group over a finite field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16502)
*Yury A. Neretin*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper discusses GL group over finite field and the interpolation of its biinvariant function algebras for varying n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of $\mathcal{A}_n$ allows for deeper insight into representation theory and harmonic analysis on general linear groups over finite fields.

Method: Analyzes structure of $\mathrm{GL}(\alpha+n, \mathbb {F}_q)$ and subgroup $H(n)$, uses generators and relations to describe $\mathcal{A}_n$ and derives its interpolation formula.

Result: Described $\mathcal{A}_n$ using generators and relations and demonstrated its natural interpolation for complex n.

Conclusion: The algebra $\mathcal{A}_n$ can be interpolated to complex n values despite its origin in a finite field GL group, suggesting robust mathematical structure.

Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be finite field with $q$ elements. Let $\alpha\leqslant
n$ be positive integers. Consider the general linear group
$\mathrm{GL}(\alpha+n, \mathbb {F}_q) $ and its subgroup $H(n)$, which fixes
the first $\alpha$ basis elements in $\mathbb {F}_q^{\alpha+n}$. Denote
$\mathcal{A}_n$ by the convolution algebra of $H(n)$-biinvariant functions on
$\mathrm{GL}(\alpha+n, \mathbb {F}_q) $. We describe algebras $\mathcal{A}_n$
in terms of generators and relations and show that the family $\mathcal{A}_n$
admits a natural interpolation to arbitrary complex $n$ (the field $\mathbb
{F}_q$ and $\alpha$ are fixed).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We demonstrate that for symmetric cubes of algebraic regular Hecke eigenforms

periods of $\mathrm{SO}(5)\times \mathrm{SO}(2)$ averaged over imaginary
quadratic fields, conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.

*Masanori Morishita*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper connects Deninger's and Connes-Consani's mathematical frameworks, aligning with a knot and prime analogy in arithmetic topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between two mathematical models and its implications for class field theory.

Method: Analyzing the mathematical structures of Deninger's foliated dynamical systems and Connes-Consani's adelic spaces through the lens of arithmetic topology.

Result: A new relation between Deninger's and Connes-Consani's models is established, harmonizing with the knot and prime analogy.

Conclusion: This connection provides a geometric perspective on class field theory, potentially influencing future mathematical research.

Abstract: We give a relation between Deninger's foliated dynamical systems associated
to abelian number fields and Connes-Consani's adelic spaces. It fits with the
analogy between knots and primes in arithmetic topology and lights up a
geometric view of class field theory.

### [5] [Transcendency of variants of Mills' constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16068)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence
$(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest
real number $\xi$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for
every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant.
Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational, but the
transcendency of this number is still open. In this paper, we give sufficient
conditions on $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ to determine the transcendency of $\xi(C_k)$.
For example, we obtain the following three results:
  (A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\geq
1+\sqrt{2}$;
  (B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental;
  (C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\geq 4.003\times
10^{14}$.
  Furthermore, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, $\xi(3^k-1)$ is transcendental.
However, we still do not know whether Mills' constant is transcendental.

### [6] [Counting the number of $2$-periodic $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16393)
*Brian Kintu*

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between
the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by
$\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the
coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$ and $d>2$ is
an integer. As before, we again study here counting problems that are inspired
by the exciting advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics
and on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then
first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$,
the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any
$\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is bounded (if
$\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus \{1,p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in
\{1,p\}$) as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic
point-counting work of Benedetto, along with a conjecture of Hutz on
$2$-periodic rational points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given
prime $p\geq 5$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then
also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of
any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or
$2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then also apply here density
and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result
obtain again counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic integer
polynomials and algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical
setting.

### [7] [The Exceptional Set in Goldbach's Problem with two Chen Primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16400)
*Lasse Grimmelt,Joni Teräväinen*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that all natural numbers $n\equiv 4\pmod 6$ are the sum of two Chen
primes (primes $p$ such that $p+2$ has at most two prime factors), apart from a
power-saving set of exceptions. This improves on various previous results and
is optimal, barring substantial progress on the twin prime or binary Goldbach
conjectures.
  The proof is based on constructing a non-negative model for the Chen primes
in a suitable approximate sense. To do this, we develop an efficient sieving
strategy that makes use of a power-saving variant of the Bombieri--Vinogradov
theorem. Furthermore, we show that the primes are well approximated in additive
problems by the Cram\'er model (rough numbers) with a sifting parameter of
power size.

### [8] [Minimal value set binomials and Frobenius nonclassical curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16541)
*Tiago Aprigio,João Paulo Guardieiro*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper characterizes minimal value set binomials over finite fields and classifies a type of quadrinomial curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of minimal value set binomials and their implications for the classification of specific algebraic curves contributes to the field of finite field mathematics and has potential applications in cryptography and coding theory.

Method: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of binomials over finite fields, identifying those with the minimal number of distinct values. Using these results, they applied methods from algebraic geometry to classify the defined quadrinomial curves.

Result: A characterization of all minimal value set binomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$ was achieved, along with a classification of all quadrinomial curves with separated variables that are $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical for the morphism of lines.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive classification of these specific binomials and curves, expanding the understanding and potential applications of algebraic structures over finite fields.

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize all minimal value set binomials over
$\mathbb{F}_q$, that is, binomials whose size of the set of images is the
smallest possible. With this information, we also classify all quadrinomial
curves with separated variables that are $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical
for the morphism of lines.
