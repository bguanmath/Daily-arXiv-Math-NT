Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study modular forms for $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ with no negative
Fourier coefficients. Let $A(k)$ be the positive integer where if the first
$A(k)$ Fourier coefficients of a modular form of weight $k$ for
$\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ are nonnegative, then all of its Fourier
coefficients are nonnegative, so that $A(k)$ can be interpreted as a
``nonnegativity Sturm bound''. We give upper and lower bounds for $A(k)$, as
well as an upper bound on the $n$th Fourier coefficient of any form with no
negative Fourier coefficients.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B,
with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images
of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over
$\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in
\{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to
understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained
in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to
determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we
consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of
genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a
correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive
integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$,
the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of
several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification
of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single
plane quartic.

### [3] [Heuristic Bounded Prime Gaps via a Chaotic Multidimensional Sieve and Random Matrix Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17986)
*Milad Ghadimi*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper introduces the EMCHS framework, combining chaotic perturbations and RMT to provide heuristic prime gap bounds of at most 180 unconditionally and 8 conditionally, with some analytic proofs and numerical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in advancing the understanding of prime gaps by building upon existing sieve methods with a novel chaotic heuristic approach that may offer tighter bounds.

Method: The method involves integrating chaotic perturbations and random matrix theory into the probabilistic framework of existing sieve theory methods like those of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim and Maynard. It uses ergodic theory to bound chaotic perturbations and offers refined polytope optimizations.

Result: The results include heuristic suggestions for prime gaps of at most 180 without additional assumptions and gaps of at most 8 under a partial EHC to beat Maynard's conditional result. Numerical evidence supports these claims up to 10^18.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that EMCHS enhances heuristic estimates for prime gaps and shows promise, but further rigorous development is needed to address unproven assumptions and to solidify the theoretical foundation.

Abstract: We present the Enhanced Multidimensional Chaotic Heuristic Sieve (EMCHS), a
novel probabilistic framework that integrates chaotic perturbations and random
matrix theory (RMT) to suggest improved bounds on prime gaps. Building upon the
foundational sieves of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim and Maynard, EMCHS heuristically
suggests unconditional gaps of at most 180 and conditional gaps of at most 8
under a partial Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (EHC) with delta = 0.3. These
heuristic suggestions surpass Maynard's unconditional bound of 246 through
refined polytope optimizations and probabilistic enhancements. We provide
rigorous proofs for certain analytic components (such as bounding chaotic
perturbations via ergodic theory) and explicitly distinguish which arguments
and conclusions are heuristic or conjectural. Numerical evidence for primes up
to 10^18 supports the framework, and we discuss limitations and avenues for
future rigorous work.

### [4] [Cannonball Polygons with Multiplicities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18057)
*Anji Dong,Katerina Saettone,Kendra Song,Alexandru Zaharescu*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization of the Cannonball Problem by utilizing integer-valued and non-increasing arithmetic functions, leading to the definition of cannonball polygons. It demonstrates the existence of such polygons for any chosen largest side length with a fixed multiplicity of 8, and derives asymptotic formulas for the number of distinct classes for multiplicities greater than 8.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is drawn from the classic Cannonball Problem, which seeks to arrange cannonballs in shapes that conform to geometric constraints; the extension here allows for a broader exploration of polygons using arithmetic functions as a tool.

Method: The authors employ the concept of integer-valued and non-increasing arithmetic functions $w$ to associate them with specific polygons (cannonball polygons). This association enables them to study the properties and existence of such polygons based on the functions' characteristics.

Result: The primary results are twofold: (1) the existence of a cannonball polygon with multiplicity 8 and any given largest side length $Z$, and (2) the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the number of distinct classes of cannonball polygons with multiplicities $s > 8$.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach to understanding generalized polygonal arrangements through arithmetic functions. By introducing the concept of cannonball polygons and analyzing their properties, the research expands the scope of the classical problem into more abstract mathematical terrains, enabling the study of asymptotic behavior in higher multiplicities.

Abstract: We generalize the Cannonball Problem by introducing integer-valued and
non-increasing arithmetic functions $w$. We associate these functions $w$ with
certain polygons, which we call cannonball polygons. Through this
correspondence, we show that for any $Z\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a
cannonball polygon with multiplicity 8 and largest side of length $Z$.
Moreover, for any multiplicity $s$ greater than 8, we provide an asymptotic
formula for the number of distinct classes of cannonball polygons with
multiplicity $s$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 1914, Hardy proved that there are infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the
Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line Re$(s)=1/2$ using the
Jacobi theta relation. In this paper, we first establish a number field
analogue of the Jacobi theta relation and as an application, we show the
existence of infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the Dedekind zeta function
$\zeta_\mathbb{F}(s)$ on Re$(s)=1/2$, for any number field $\mathbb{F}$. Quite
interestingly, we also prove that the Jacobi theta relation is equivalent to an
intriguing identity of Hardy, Littlewood and Ramanujan.

### [6] [On the Laurent series Expansions of the Barnes Double Zeta-Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18152)
*Takashi Miyagawa*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper computes the Laurent series expansion of the Barnes double zeta function at s=1 and s=2, and shows the appearnce of Euler-Stieltjes-like constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laurent series expansion near poles is important in the study of zeta functions, and the paper focuses on the Barnes double zeta function.

Method: The authors computes the Laurent series expansions of the Barnes double zeta-function at s=1 and s=2.

Result: They found that constants analogous to the Euler-Stieltjes constants appear in the constant term in the expansion.

Conclusion: The research extends the understanding of the Barnes double zeta-function at s=1 and s=2, and reveals the presence of certain constants in its expansion.

Abstract: The Laurent series expansions of complex functions play a crucial role in
analyzing their behavior near poles. In particular, Laurent series expansions
have been extensively studied in the theory of zeta-functions. It is well known
that the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann zeta-function features the
Euler-Stieltjes constants in its coefficients. Similar phenomena occur in the
Laurent series expansion of the Hurwitz zeta-function, which is of considerable
interest.
  In this paper, we compute the Laurent series expansions of the Barnes double
zeta-function $ \zeta_2 (s, \alpha ; v, w ) $ at $s=1$ and $s=2$, and show that
a constant analogous to the Euler-Stieltjes constant appears in the constant
term.

*Peng Gao,Liangyi Zhao*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper evaluates twisted four moment on the critical line of Dirichlet L-functions with a fixed prime power modulus and achieve a power saving error term in an asymptotic formula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of moments of L-functions is important for understanding their distribution and behavior, particularly in connection with the Riemann Hypothesis and other deep conjectures in number theory.

Method: The authors use asymptotic analysis to evaluate the twisted four moment on the critical line. The specific techniques involve intricate calculations related to Dirichlet L-functions with a fixed prime power modulus, leading to an asymptotic formula with a power saving error term.

Result: The paper derives an asymptotic formula for the twisted four moment on the critical line for Dirichlet L-functions with a fixed prime power modulus, featuring a power saving error term. This result contributes to the understanding of the distribution of these specific L-functions.

Conclusion: The research successfully achieves its goal of providing a precise asymptotic formula with a power saving error term for the twisted four moment in the context of Dirichlet L-functions with a fixed prime power modulus, enhancing our comprehension of their critical line behavior.

Abstract: We evaluate the twisted four moment on the critical line of the family of
Dirichlet $L$-functions to a fixed prime power modulus, obtaining an asymptotic
formula with a power saving error term.

### [8] [The Exact Enumeration of $4$-nomial and $5$-nomial Multiples of the Product of Primitive Polynomials over GF(2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18465)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are used to generate secret keys in
stream cipher cryptosystems. There are different kinds of key-stream generators
like filter generators, combination generators, clock-controlled generators,
etc. For a combination generator, the connection polynomial is the product of
the connection polynomials of constituent LFSRs. For better cryptographic
properties, the connection polynomials of the constituent LFSRs should be
primitive with coprime degrees. The cryptographic systems using LFSRs as their
components are vulnerable to correlation attacks. The attack heavily depends on
the $t$-nomial multiples of the connection polynomial for small values of $t$.
In 2005, Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu provided a lower bound for the number
of $t$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials over GF(2). The
lower bound is exact when $t=3$. In this article, we provide the exact number
of $4$-nomial and $5$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials.
This helps us to choose a more suitable connection polynomial to resist the
correlation attacks. Next, we disprove a conjecture by Maitra, Gupta, and
Venkateswarlu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于BSD不变和其他表示不变之间关系的疑惑，研究是否存在具有相同BSD及其他关键不变但非同构的椭圆曲线集合的无限性问题。

Method: 运用数论与代数几何中的构造和比较方法，特别是在BSD体系参数之间的深入分析以及利用相关数学工具排除同构的可能性。

Result: 首次建立了具有相同BSD不变量、其他表示不变及最小判别式但非同构的无限多对椭圆曲线的存在性。

Conclusion: 揭示了椭圆曲线分类中的新颖不变性质，对 BSD 猜想和相关曲线属性理论提出了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We prove that there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic elliptic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ sharing the same BSD invariants -- including their
$L$-functions, Mordell--Weil groups, Tate--Shafarevich groups, Tamagawa
numbers, regulators, and real periods -- and their Kodaira symbols and minimal
discriminants, while having distinct $j$-invariants.

### [10] [Evaluation of a determinant involving Legendre symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18589)
*Chen-Kai Ren,Zhi-Wei Sun*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: 本文完全求出了 $\det A_p(x)$ 的值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是解决 Z.-W. Sun 于2018年提出的关于矩阵行列式的猜想，即当 $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ 时，$\det A_p(0) = -2^{(p-3)/2}$，该猜想已被 G. Zaimi 证实，但完全求解 $\det A_p(x)$ 的情况仍需研究。

Method: 通过定义矩阵 $A_p(x)$，并分析其元素的排列和计算方法，作者采用了数论中的方法和技巧，特别是涉及到莱让德符号 $\left(\frac{\cdot}{p}\right)$，来评估不同 $x$ 值下的行列式值。

Result: 作者成功求出了 $\det A_p(x)$ 的完整表达式，解答了不同 $x$ 以及给定素数 $p$ 的情况下的结果。这对于验证和扩展 Z.-W. Sun 的猜想具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是通过数论方法完全求解了 $\det A_p(x)$，为进一步研究相关数学问题提供了重要的理论基础。

Abstract: Let $p>3$ be a prime, and let $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ be the Legendre symbol. Let
$A_p(x)$ denote the matrix $[x+a_{ij}]_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant (p-1)/2}$,
where $$ a_{ij}=\begin{cases} (\frac{j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i=1, \$\frac{i+j}{p})
&\text{if} \ i>1. \end{cases}$$ In 2018 Z.-W. Sun conjectured that $\det
A_p(0)=-2^{(p-3)/2}$ if $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, which was later confirmed by G.
Zaimi. In this paper we evaluate $\det A_p(x)$ completely.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider Borcherds algebras with no real roots and the property that all
zeroes in the Borcherds Cartan matrix occur in a single diagonal zero block. It
follows that all other entries of the matrix are negative. We give a structure
theorem for these Borcherds algebras, decomposing them into free, Heisenberg
and abelian subalgebras. We show that a class of such Borcherds algebras are
the Monstrous Lie algebras associated to non-Fricke elements of the Monster
finite simple group. This new perspective on their structure gives an efficient
method to compute their twisted denominator formulas.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected
reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective
space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the
categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation
$(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the
algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V,
\mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the
representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is
an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra
$\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of
the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential
$\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of
the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant
differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The
main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories
between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left(
V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $
and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules
modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization
of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an
algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic
$\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of
skew-symmetric matrices.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Sakellaridis-Venkatesh conjecture for the rank-1
spherical variety $X=\text{Spin}_9\backslash F_4$ using an exceptional theta
correspondence. We establish the correct transfer map satisfying relative
character identities in this case and show that our transfer map agrees with
the formula in (Sakellaridis, 2021). Moreover, we show how our techniques lead
to a characterization of $X$-relatively cuspidal representations.
