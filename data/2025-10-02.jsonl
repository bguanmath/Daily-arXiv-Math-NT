We prove that this maximal fraction is asymptotically\n$O(n^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, for any set of arithmetic restrictions, we\nestablish the existence of a minimal lower bound on the parts beyond which the\ninfluence of these restrictions on the fraction of graphical partitions becomes\nnegligible; in this regime, the fraction depends primarily on the choice of\nthis lower bound. We highlight a key example of partitions restricted to powers\nof 2, where the critical lower bound is found to be\n$\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\log2}+O(\\log n)$."}

Barrios", "Chung Pang Mok"], "title": "On the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula modulo squares for certain quadratic twists of elliptic curves", "comment": "35 pages", "summary": "Let $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with conductor $N=N_+N_-$, where\n$N_+$ and $N_-$ are coprime and $N_-$ is squarefree. Let $D$ be a positive\nfundamental discriminant satisfying the modified Heegner hypothesis with\nrespect to $(N_+,N_-)$: primes dividing $N_+$ (resp. $N_-$) split (resp. are\ninert) in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$; we denote by $E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$ the quadratic\ntwist of $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ by $D$. In the first half of the paper we consider the\nsituation where $N_-$ is a squarefree product of an odd number of distinct\nprimes, and we show the following: assuming that $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic\nrank zero (resp. one), and that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula holds for\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}$ modulo $(\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})^2$, then for those $D$ such that\n$E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic rank one (resp. zero), we also have the\nvalidity of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$ modulo\n$(\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})^2$. To show this, we establish auxiliary results without\nrank assumptions. The most difficult case is when $D$ is even, and our proof\ncrucially relies on the recent classification of how local Tamagawa numbers\nchange under quadratic twists. In the final part of the paper analogous results\nare also obtained in the other situation when $N_-$ is a squarefree product of\nan even number distinct primes, concerning the case when both $E/\\mathbb{Q}$\nand $E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$ have analytic rank zero (resp. one).\n  As a consequence of our work, we obtain that if $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is semistable\nwith conductor $N$ and whose analytic rank is at most one, then for any\npositive fundamental discriminant $D$ that is coprime to $N$, such that\n$E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$ again has analytic rank at most one, we have that the Birch\nand Swinnerton-Dyer formula modulo $(\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times})^2$ holds for\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it holds for $E^D/\\mathbb{Q}$."}

Such Shimura varieties parametrize abelian varieties in\ncharacteristic $p$ of dimension $5$ with an action of signature $(3,2)$ by an\norder in an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ is inert. We completely\ndescribe the interaction of two stratifications of these Shimura varieties: the\nEkedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion\nsubgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of\nthe $p$-divisible group. We identify which Ekedahl-Oort and Newton strata\nintersect."}
