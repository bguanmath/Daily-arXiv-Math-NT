Our\nproof uses the results of our recent joint work with Raghuram in combination\nwith the Ichino--Ikeda--Neal-Harris (IINH) formula for unitary groups -- which\nis now a theorem -- and an analysis of cup products of coherent cohomological\nautomorphic forms on Shimura varieties to establish relations between certain\nautomorphic periods and critical values of Rankin-Selberg and Asai\n$L$-functions of $\\GL(n)\\times\\GL(m)$ over CM fields. By reinterpreting these\ncritical values in terms of automorphic periods of holomorphic automorphic\nforms on unitary groups, we show that the automorphic periods of holomorphic\nforms can be factored as products of coherent cohomological forms, compatibly\nwith a motivic factorization predicted by the Tate conjecture.

The constant D combines geometric\naspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal\nof the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m\ne. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism\nfrom the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked\nto nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity.
