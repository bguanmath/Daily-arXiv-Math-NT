### [1] [Scarcity of partition congruences on semiprime progressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19512)

Abstract: In recent work with Raum the authors considered congruences for the ordinary
partition function $p(n)$ of the form $p(\ell Q^r n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod\ell$
where $\ell, Q\geq 5$ are prime and $r\in \{1,2\}$, and proved a number of
results which show that such congruences are scarce in a precise sense. Here we
improve one of our results when $r=1$; in particular we prove (outside of
trivial cases) that the set of primes $Q$ such that there exists $\beta\in
\mathbb{Z}$ with $p(\ell Q n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod \ell$ for all $n$ has density
zero. The proof involves a modification of part of our previous argument and an
application of a recent theorem of Dicks regarding modular forms of
half-integral weight and level one modulo $\ell$.

Abstract: For nonzero coprime integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said
to be \emph{good with respect to $a$ and $b$} if there exists a positive
integer $k$ such that $\ell$ divides $a^{k} + b^{k}$. The concept of good
integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due
to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications
in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a
comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical
foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental
number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their
characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with
well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their
computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good
integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in
the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes
and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples
are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not
only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of
good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be a self-dual Hecke character over a CM field $K$. Let
$\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of the maximal totally real subfield $F$ of $K$ and
$\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}$ the Galois group of the maximal anticyclotomic
${\mathbb{Z}}_{p}^{deg \mathfrak{p}}$-extension of $K$ unramified outside
$\mathfrak{p}$. We prove that $$L(1,\lambda\nu)\neq 0$$ for all but finitely
many finite order characters $\nu$ of $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}$ such that
$\epsilon(\lambda\nu)=+1$. For an ordinary prime $\ell$ with respect to the CM
quadratic extension $K/F$, we also determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of the
normalised Hecke $L$-values $L^{{\mathrm{alg}}}(1,\lambda\nu)$. As an
application, we complete Hsieh's proof of Eisenstein congruence divisibility
towards the CM Iwasawa main conjecture over $K$.
  Our approach and results complement the prior work initiated by Hida's ideas
on the arithmetic of Hilbert modular Eisenstein series, studied via mod $\ell$
analogue of the Andr\'e--Oort conjecture. The previous results established the
non-vanishing only for a Zariski dense subset of characters $\nu$. Our approach
is based on the arithmetic of a CM modular form on a Shimura set, studied via
arithmetic of the CM field and Ratner's ergodicity of unipotent flows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, we compute the dimension of
the reduced Emerton-Gee stacks, and give an explicit description of their
top-dimensional Chow group. Our results are unconditional when $p\neq 2$.
  The main innovation is a new method for analyzing the vanishing locus of
Galois cup products valued in high dimensions.

### [5] [Two-color partitions and overpartitions: a combinatorial proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19741)
*Anton Bugleev*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper provides a combinatorial proof for identities related to two-color partitions using two-modular diagrams, addressing previous conjectures by George Andrews and Mohamed El Bachraoui.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Andrews and El Bachraoui previously studied two-colored partitions and overpartitions analytically and conjectured the existence of combinatorial proofs. This paper aims to fulfill that conjecture with a constructive approach.

Method: The authors utilize two-modular diagrams, a combinatorial tool, to model and analyze the identities of two-color partitions.

Result: A combinatorial proof for the main result of Andrews and El Bachraoui is established using two-modular diagrams, confirming the conjecture.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the application of two-modular diagrams in proving identities of two-color partitions, thereby contributing a combinatorial perspective to the field.

Abstract: George Andrews and Mohamed El Bachraoui recently explored identities for
two-color partitions. In particular, they studied the connection between
two-colored partitions and overpartitions. Their proofs were analytical, but
they conjectured combinatorial proofs of their results. In this paper we use
two-modular diagrams to give a combinatorial proof of their main result.

provide arbitrarily good rational approximations and converge arbitrarily
quickly.

### [7] [On a non-abelian analogue of a conjecture of Michael Stoll](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19947)
*L. Alexander Betts*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper formulates a non-abelian version of Stoll's conjecture related to Kim's non-abelian Chabauty method. It proves the conjecture for quadratic rank 0 cases and applies this to determine the structure of quadratic Chabauty loci on once-punctured elliptic curves with rank 0, using a modified geometric technique and reducing the problem to known intersection theory results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize Stoll's conjecture to the non-abelian setting and understand the structure of loci defined by Kim's non-abelian Chabauty method. A specific focus is placed on the implications for once-punctured elliptic curves of rank 0.

Method: The approach involves establishing a non-abelian version of Stoll's conjecture and proving the quadratic rank 0 case by adapting Edixhoven and Lido's geometric quadratic Chabauty method, reducing the problem to an unlikely intersections issue and referencing the Manin--Mumford Conjecture.

Result: The result is the proof of the non-abelian generalisation of Stoll's conjecture in the quadratic rank 0 case. This proof determines the quadratic Chabauty locus structure on once-punctured elliptic curves of rank 0 and provides insights into non-abelian Chabauty methods through geometric reduction techniques.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of non-abelian Chabauty loci by proving a conjecture for quadratic rank 0, suggesting potential for applying similar reductions to other cases and strengthening the method's theoretical foundation in arithmetic geometry.

Abstract: We formulate a non-abelian generalisation of a conjecture of Stoll, which
conjecturally describes the structure of the loci cut out by Kim's method of
non-abelian Chabauty. We prove the rank 0 quadratic case of this conjecture,
which in particular determines the structure of the quadratic Chabauty locus
for once-punctured elliptic curves of rank 0. The proof involves using a
variant of the geometric quadratic Chabauty method of Edixhoven and Lido to
reduce to an unlikely intersections problem, and ultimately to known results
about the relative Manin--Mumford Conjecture.

### [8] [Search for a basis of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, using rewriting systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19360)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We begin by defining Temperley-Lieb algebra, in two different ways: as a
presented algebra or as a diagrammatic algebra. Next, we look for a basis
algorithmically, using rewriting theory. Finally, we introduce a generalization
of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, which is an oriented version of the previous
one. This pushes us to employ a more efficient tool, category theory, to use
rewriting to easily obtain a basis for the algebra.

### [9] [Bound on multiplicities of symmetric pairs over p-adic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19738)
*Shahar Dagan*

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish uniform bounds on the multiplicities of irreducible admissible
representations appearing in spaces of functions on symmetric spaces over
$p$-adic fields. These multiplicities can exceed one and depend intricately on
the group, the space, and the representation, making exact computations often
infeasible. This motivates the search for bounds depending only on simple
structural parameters.
  More precisely, let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean
local field $F$ of odd residual characteristic, and let $\theta$ be a rational
involution with fixed-point subgroup $H = G^\theta$. For any unramified smooth
character $\chi$ of $H$, we show that the multiplicity
  \[
  \dim \mathrm{Hom}_G(\rho, C^\infty(G/H,\chi))
  \] is uniformly bounded for a broad class of irreducible admissible
representations $\rho$ of $G$, conjecturally including all such
representations. The bound depends only on the rank of $G$ and the residue
degree of $F$. Our method combines Mackey theory with cohomological techniques.
  As an application, we deduce a uniform bound on such multiplicities for all
but finitely many local completions of a fixed number field.

### [10] [Homological Bounds of Gentle algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19763)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper studies the homological bounds of gentle algebras, i.e., the upper
bounds for the sum of the projective and injective dimensions of indecomposable
modules over gentle algebras. We provide conditions under which this sum is
strictly less than twice the global dimension, and as an application, we give a
characterization of quasi-tilted gentle algebras.
