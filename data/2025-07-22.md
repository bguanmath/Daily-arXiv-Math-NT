Abstract: Let $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions
and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver
presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$
is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of
two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and
that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the
proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced
left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$. We also define
$\operatorname{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ with an
artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant
functions. We show that
$\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\operatorname{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where
$\operatorname{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the
set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is
not $2$ we prove that
$\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}$.
As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}$
consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions
of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention
Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to
seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of
self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept
of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving
that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a
direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components
are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting
permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for
disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers
substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to
novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented
interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention
contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational
efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric
subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to
dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms,
showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of
biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding
and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of
biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely
$\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow
\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with
$n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics
of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness.
Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual
twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find
their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for
the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be
extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while
$\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq
2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For $G$ a finite group, $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$, and $S$ a
Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the Sylow permutation module $\mathrm{Ind}^G_S(k)$
plays a role in diverse facets of representation theory and group theory,
ranging from Alperin's weight conjecture to statistical considerations of
$S$-$S$-double cosets in $G$. The Sylow permutation module breaks up along the
block decomposition of the group algebra $kG$, but the resulting block
components are not invariant under splendid Morita equivalences. We introduce a
summand of the block component, which we call source permutation module, which
is shown to be invariant under such equivalences. We investigate general
structural properties of the source permutation module and we show that
well-known results relating the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of
the Sylow permutation to Alperin's weight conjecture carry over to the source
permutation module. We calculate this module in various cases, such as certain
blocks with cyclic defect group and blocks with a Klein four defect group, and
for some blocks of symmetric groups, prompted by a question in a recent paper
by Diaconis-Giannelli-Guralnick-Law-Navarro-Sambale-Spink on the
self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation module
for symmetric groups.

Method: 作者引入并分析了特征标$$\chi$$在有限群$$G$$中取零值或单位根值的元素比例$$\theta(\chi)$$，并通过构造性方法证明了对于给定$$L$$和$$\epsilon$$，存在满足条件的特征标。

Result: 结果显示，对于给定的$$L$$和$$\epsilon$$，可以找到有限群的不可约特征标$$\chi$$，使得比例$$\theta(\chi)$$距离$$L$$不超过$$\epsilon$$。

Abstract: For any irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$, let
$\theta(\chi)$ denote the proportion of elements $g\in G$ for which $\chi(g)$
is either zero or a root of unity. Then for any $L\in[1/2,1]$ and any
$\epsilon>0$, there exists an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group
such that $|\theta(\chi)-L|<\epsilon$.

### [6] [Symmetric powers of $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and $D^{(n-1,1)}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15505)
*Pavel Turek,Jialin Wang*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: The paper establishes new decompositions for symmetric powers of the Specht module and an irreducible module in characteristic $p$ as direct sums of Young permutation modules, and applies these to show the existence of Specht filtrations and determine vertices of indecomposable summands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation likely stems from a desire to better understand the structure of symmetric powers of Specht and irreducible modules in modular representation theory, particularly in the context of finite groups and Hecke algebras. Establishing such decompositions is a key step in determining module filtrations and vertices.

Method: The authors use a general construction involving lifting a splitting map of a short exact sequence for certain symmetric powers to a similar splitting map for higher symmetric powers. This approach provides a uniform method to decompose these symmetric powers into sums of Young permutation modules.

Result: The main results are new decomposition formulas for the first $p-1$ symmetric powers of the Specht module $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and the irreducible module $D^{(n-1,1)}$ in characteristic $p$, along with the demonstration that these symmetric powers have Specht filtrations and determination of the vertices of their indecomposable summands.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the new decomposition formulas and techniques provide valuable tools for studying symmetric powers and filtrations in modular representation theory, potentially applicable to a broader family of modules, enhancing the understanding of module structures and their vertex properties.

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $n\geq 2$ be a positive integer. We establish new
formulae for the decompositions of the first $p-1$ symmetric powers of the
Specht module $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and the irreducible module $D^{(n-1,1)}$ in
characteristic $p$ as direct sums of Young permutation modules. As an
application of the formulae, we show that these symmetric powers have Specht
filtration and find the vertices of their indecomposable summands. Our main
tool, constructed in this paper, is a lift of a splitting map of a short exact
sequence of certain symmetric powers to a splitting map of a short exact
sequence of higher symmetric powers. This is a general construction, which can
be applied to a broader family of modules.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear
degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is
the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in
previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz.
These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver
Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the
algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above
for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits
in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially
defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in
the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a
type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is
computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides
with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C.
Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial
cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus
with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is
proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.

Abstract: Let $\ell\geq 5$ be prime. Let $\mathcal{F}_\ell$ be the collection of
(isomorphism classes of) pure number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[\ell]{a})$ of
degree $\ell$, ordered by the absolute value of their discriminant. In 2018,
Benli proved a counting theorem for $\mathcal{F}_\ell$, generalizing a previous
theorem of Cohen and Morra when $\ell=3$. We prove that the proportion of pure
fields of degree $\ell$ with genus number one is asymptotic to $(A_\ell \log
X)^{-1}$ and that the average genus number for pure fields of degree $\ell$ is
asymptotic to $B_\ell(\log X)^{\ell-1}$. Both $A_\ell$ and $B_\ell$ are
expressed explicitly as a product over primes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The well-known sequence $\vartheta_n = \vartheta(p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln p_i=
\ln\left([p_n]\#\right)$ exhibits numerous extremely interesting properties.
Since $p_n = \exp(\vartheta_n - \vartheta_{n-1})$, it is immediately clear that
the two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \vartheta_n$ must ultimately encode
exactly the same information. But the sequence $\vartheta_n$, while being
extremely closely correlated with the primes, (in fact, $\vartheta_n \sim
p_n$), is very much better behaved than the primes themselves. Using numerous
suitable extensions of various reasonably standard results, I shall demonstrate
that the sequence $\vartheta_n$ satisfies suitably defined
$\vartheta$-analogues of the usual Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann,
Brocard, Firoozbakht, Fourges, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these
$\vartheta$-analogues are not conjectures, they are instead theorems.) The
crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the regularity (and relative
smallness) of the $\theta$-gaps $\mathfrak{g}_n = \vartheta_{n+1}-\vartheta_n=
\ln p_{n+1}$. While superficially these results bear close resemblance to some
recently derived results for the averaged primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n}
\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, both the broad outline and the technical details of the
arguments given and proofs presented are quite radically distinct.

Abstract: We study the weighted multilinear polynomial averages in finite fields. The

P_1(\varphi(y))v_1,\cdots, \textbf{x}+ P_k(\varphi(y))v_k, \] where
$\mathbb{V}=\{v_1, \cdots, v_{k} \in \mathbb{Z}^D\}$ is a collection of nonzero
vectors, $\mathbb{P}= \{P_1, \cdots, P_{k}\in \mathbb{Z}[y]\}$ is a collection
of linearly independent polynomials with zero constant terms, and $\varphi(y)
\in \mathbb{Q}(y)$ is a nonzero rational function.

Abstract: The minimal excludant statistic, which denotes the smallest positive integer
that is not a part of an integer partition, has received great interest in
recent years. In this paper, we move on to the smallest positive integer whose
frequency is less than a given number. We establish an asymptotic formula for
the moments of such generalized minimal excludants that fall in a specific
congruence class. In particular, our estimation reveals that the moments
associated with a fixed modulus are asymptotically ``equal''.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the non-vanishing problem for the family of
special Hecke--Maass $L$-values $ L (1/2+it_f, f) $ with $f (z)$ in an
orthonormal basis of (even or odd) Hecke--Maass cusp forms of Laplace
eigenvalue $1/4 + t_f^2$ ($t_f > 0$). We prove that 33% of $L (1/2+it_f, f)$
for $ t_f \leqslant T$ do not vanish as $T \rightarrow \infty$. For comparison,
it is known that the non-vanishing proportion is at least 25% for the central
$L$-values $L (1/2, f)$. Further, 33% may be raised to 50% conditionally on the
generalized Riemann hypothesis. Moreover, we prove non-vanishing results on
short intervals $|t_f-T| \leqslant T^{\mu}$ for any $0 < \mu < 1$. However, it
is a curious case that the Riemann hypothesis does not yield better result for
small $0 < \mu \leqslant 1/2$.

F_q^{\times 2}$. We show that under any identification of $\mathbb C$ with

$c(\pi;H,K_{\alpha,u}) \neq 0$ for all irreducible representations $\pi$ of $G$

Abstract: In the study of Euclidean lattices, the product of the successive minima is
bounded from above and below by explicit quantities. This result is known as
Minkowski's second theorem, and can be refined to include Hermite's constant in
the upper bound, which measures how short a non-zero vector can be in a given
lattice. A version of this result exists in the context of number fields, where
lattices are replaced with rigid adelic spaces, and successive minima with the
Roy--Thunder minima. In this paper, drawing on the analogy between rank $2$
Euclidean lattices and points in $\mathbb{H}$, we will see an analogy between
$2$-dimensional rigid adelic spaces and points in $\mathbb{H}^n$, and use that
to translate the Minkowski-type theorem on Roy--Thunder minima into a theorem
on the distances to cusps in $\mathbb{H}^n$.

Motivation: Understanding the transcendence properties of Frobenius traces provides insights into the arithmetic and distribution of elliptic curves over number fields.

Method: The study involves analyzing Frobenius traces within the context of the 'poor man's ad\`ele ring' to demonstrate their transcendence over the rational numbers.

Result: The sequence of Frobenius traces $(a_p(E))_p$ for a non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over $\\\$\mathbb Q" is shown to be transcendental.

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve without complex multiplication defined over

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a $p$-adic theory of periods for 1-motives, extending the
classical theory of complex periods into the non-archimedean setting. For
1-motives with good reduction over $p$-adic local fields, we construct a
$p$-adic integration pairing that generalizes the Colmez--Fontaine--Messing
theory for abelian varieties. This pairing is bilinear, perfect,
Galois-equivariant, and compatible with the Hodge filtration, taking values in
a quotient of the de Rham period ring.
  Building on this construction, we introduce a stratified formalism for
$p$-adic periods, defining period spaces at various depths that capture
increasingly refined relations among periods, and formulating conjectures that
mirror the Grothendieck period conjecture in this new context. The classical
period conjecture for 1-motives over $\bar{Q}$, previously resolved via the
Huber--Wustholz analytic subgroup theorem, is recovered at depth 1 in our
framework. For 1-motives over number fields with good reduction at $p$, we
identify canonical $Q$-structures on the $p$-adic realizations arising from
rational points of their associated formal $p$-divisible groups. Relative to
these structures, we establish the conjectures at depths 1 and 2.
  A key tool is the development of a $p$-adic analytic subgroup theorem
tailored to 1-motives, providing an analogue of Wustholz's classical result.
Our work not only yields a $p$-adic counterpart to the Kontsevich--Zagier
conjecture for 1-motives but also opens new pathways for the study of linear
relations among $p$-adic periods and their transcendence properties.

Motivation: Arakawa-Kaneko and Euler-Zagier multiple zeta functions are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, which have connections to integrability and enumerative geometry. The motivation of the paper is to prove the relation between them and provide explicit formulas.

Method: The method of the paper involves constructing explicit formulas for the relation and proving the corresponding functional equations among multi-polylogarithm functions.

Result: The results of the paper include the derivation of explicit formulas for the relation between Arakawa-Kaneko and Euler-Zagier type multiple zeta functions, as well as certain functional equations among multi-polylogarithm functions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating that the relation between Arakawa-Kaneko and Euler-Zagier multiple zeta functions can be represented as a rational combination and introduces the functional equations as a crucial key to its proof.

Abstract: Multiple zeta functions of Arakawa-Kaneko and Euler-Zagier types are known as
generalizations of the Riemann zeta function. In 2018, Kaneko and Tsumura
proved that the multiple zeta functions of Arakawa-Kaneko type can be expressed
as a ${\mathbb Q}$-linear combination of products of the ones of Euler-Zagier
type and multiple zeta values. In this paper, we give explicit formulas to the
above mentioned relation. Moreover, as a key of its proof, we also give certain
functional equations among multi-polylogarithm functions explicitly.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Theta Partial operator
$\theta(y\mathbf{D}_{\lambda})$, based on the $\lambda$-derivative operator
$\mathbf{D}_{\lambda}$, and use it to define the following generalization of
the Lambert series \begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\frac{x^{n+1}}{x-\lambda^ny}z^n. \end{equation*} Also,
we define generalized Lambert-Mehler and Lambert-Rogers type series, double-sum
bivariate generalized Lambert series and multivariate generalized Lambert
series. A list of interesting generalized Lambert series is provided by using
elementary functions.

Abstract: Ingham (1940) proved that $N(\sigma,T)\ll
T^{3(1-\sigma)/(2-\sigma)}\log^{5}{T}$, where $N(\sigma,T)$ counts the number
of the non-trivial zeros $\rho$ of the Riemann zeta-function with
$\Re\{\rho\}\geq\sigma\geq 1/2$ and $0<\Im\{\rho\}\leq T$. We provide an
explicit version of this result with the exponent $3$ of the logarithmic
factor. In addition, we also provide an explicit estimate with asymptotically
correct main term for the fourth power moment of the Riemann zeta-function on
the critical line.

Motivation: 共周期积分和theta级数在自守形式理论和数论中扮演重要角色，揭示了深刻的关系和结构，因此研究它们具有重要的理论价值。

Method: 通过局部分析显示$\text{Hom}$-空间始终是一维的，并进行非分歧计算；在全局方面，提供了艾森斯坦系列的共周期积分的欧拉分解，并从局部重数一的结果推导出尖点自守形式的存在性。

Result: 证明了局部共周期积分的同构性质，得到了对称立方L-函数中心值的非零尖点自守形式的存在性，并提出了Ichino-Ikeda型猜想。

Conclusion: 文章的分析结果为理解自守形式与L-函数之间的关系提供了新的视角，并为进一步的研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: In this article, we study the co-period integral attached to an automorphic
form on $\GL(2)$ and two exceptional theta series on the cubic
Kazhdan-Patterson cover of $\GL(2)$. In the local aspect, we show the
$\Hom$-space is always of one dimension and conduct the unramified
calculations. In the global aspect, we give the Euler decomposition for the
co-period integrals of Eisenstein series and propose an Ichino-Ikeda type
conjecture relating the co-period integrals of cuspidal forms to the central
critical value of symmetric cube $L$-functions. We also deduce from the local
multiplicity one result that there exist cuspidal automorphic forms with
prescribed local components and non-vanishing central symmetric cube
$L$-values.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a zero-free region and an averaged zero-density estimate for all
Dirichlet $L$-functions modulo $q$, we refine the error terms of the prime
number theorem in all and almost all short arithmetic progressions. For
example, if we assume the Generalized Density Hypothesis, then for any
arithmetic progression modulo $q\leq \log^{\ell} x$ with $\ell>0$ and any
$\alpha>\frac{2}{3}$, the prime number theorem holds in all intervals
$(x,x+\sqrt{x}\exp(\log^\alpha x)]$ and almost all intervals
$(x,x+\exp(\log^\alpha x)]$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$. This refines the classic
intervals $(x,x+x^{1/2+\varepsilon}]$ and $(x,x+x^\varepsilon]$ for any
$\varepsilon>0$.

Abstract: We study the continued fractions with bounded odd/even-order partial
quotients. In particular, we investigate the sizes of the sets of continued
fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1. We demonstrate that
the sum and the product of two sets of continued fractions whose odd-order
partial quotients are equal to 1 both contain non-empty intervals. Our work
compliments the results of Han\v{c}l and Turek on the set of continued
fractions whose even-order partial quotients are equal to 1. Furthermore, we
determine the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets of continued fractions whose
odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1 and even-order partial quotients are
growing at an exponential rate, a super-exponential rate, and in general a
positive function rate.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$
of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent
polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic
polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q)
= C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq
1$ there is a unique degree $n-1$ polynomial ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in
{\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In
this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value
${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$
polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is
a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the
first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear
combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by
an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if
and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.
