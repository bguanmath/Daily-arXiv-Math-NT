If this has Zassenhaus type $(3,3)$, there are 13 possibilities for the isomorphism class of the finite quotient $G_K/D_4(G_K)$.\n  We prove that for 10 of these 13 cases $G_K$ is either finite or isomorphic to an open subgroup of a form of $\\mathop{\\rm PGL}_2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_3$. Combined with the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, or with earlier work on an analogue of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic for Schur $\u03c3$-groups, this lends credence to the \"if\" part of a conjecture of McLeman.\n  Using explicit computations of triple Massey products, we also test the heuristic for all imaginary quadratic fields $K$ with $d(G_K)=2$ and discriminant $-10^8 < d_K < 0$ and find a reasonably good agreement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u7684\u6700\u5927\u975e\u5206\u6b67 pro-3 \u6269\u5f20\u7684 Galois \u7fa4 G_K \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86 McLeman \u731c\u60f3\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Massey \u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1 McLeman \u731c\u60f3\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u6700\u5927\u975e\u5206\u6b67 pro-3 \u6269\u5f20 Galois \u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408 Fontaine-Mazur \u731c\u60f3\u548c\u7c7b\u4f3c Cohen--Lenstra \u7684\u542f\u53d1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8 G_K \u7684\u6709\u9650\u6027\u6216\u4e0e PGL_2 \u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u6839\u636e G_K \u7684 Zassenhaus \u7c7b\u578b (3,3) \u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u6784\u7c7b\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e2d 10 \u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b G_K \u8981\u4e48\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u540c\u6784\u4e8e Q_3 \u4e0a PGL_2 \u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5f00\u5b50\u7fa4\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528 Fontaine-Mazur \u731c\u60f3\u548c\u5df2\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301 McLeman \u731c\u60f3\uff1b4) \u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u91cd Massey \u79ef\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3 d(G_K)=2 \u4e14\u5224\u522b\u5f0f -10^8 < d_K < 0 \u7684\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u543b\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728 13 \u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684 G_K/D_4(G_K) \u540c\u6784\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c10 \u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684 G_K \u8981\u4e48\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u540c\u6784\u4e8e Q_3 \u4e0a PGL_2 \u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5f00\u5b50\u7fa4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 Massey \u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a McLeman \u731c\u60f3\u7684 \"\u5982\u679c\" \u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u6700\u5927\u975e\u5206\u6b67 pro-3 \u6269\u5f20 Galois \u7fa4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a McLeman \u731c\u60f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002Massey \u79ef\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u826f\u597d\u543b\u5408\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u865a\u4e8c\u6b21\u57df\u7c7b\u57df\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u731c\u60f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
