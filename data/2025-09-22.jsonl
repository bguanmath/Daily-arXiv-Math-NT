In particular, we show that all such groups are either\nabelian, or Camina groups. We then compute the dimension of each Terwilliger\nalgebra, and we also express each of the group association schemes with an\nalmost commutative Terwilliger algebra as a wreath product of the group schemes\nof finite abelian groups and $1-$class association schemes. Furthermore, we\ngive the non-primary primitive idempotents for each Terwilliger algebra for\nthose groups."}
