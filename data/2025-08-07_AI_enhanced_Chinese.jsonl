They also identified when these biases tend toward\none-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate\nbiases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we\nextend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races)\nand precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they\ntend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows).

Surprisingly, once r $\\ge$ 3\nthis criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional.
