Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed\npoints on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver\nvarieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions\nbefore and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule\" for vertex\nfunctions.\n  Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the\nfactorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The\nbranching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special\ncases, it also provides a formula for the $\\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex\nfunctions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over\nreverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture,\nsuch expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma\nmodules on the 3d mirror dual side.\n  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what\ncan be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums\nof Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional\nframing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking\nproducts."}

Kleshchev and P. H. Tiep in\n2025, concerning the conductor $c(\\chi)$ of an irreducible character $\\chi$ of\na finite group $G$. We connect the conjecture with the following construction:\nFor any positive integer $n$ dividing the exponent of $G$ and for any character\n$\\chi$ of $G$, we introduce an integer-valued invariant $S(G,\\chi,n)$ which can\nbe defined as the sum of certain coefficients of the canonical Brauer induction\nformula of $\\chi$, or alternatively as the multiplicity of the trivial\ncharacter in a specified integral linear combination of Adams operations of\n$\\chi$. We show two facts about this invariant. The first seems of independent\ninterest (apart from Feit's conjecture): $S(G,\\chi,n)$ is always non-negative,\nand it is positive if and only if a representation affording $\\chi$ involves an\neigenvalue of order $n$. Secondly, the strong version of Feit's conjecture\nholds for an irreducible character $\\chi$ if and only if $S(G,\\chi,\nc(\\chi))>0$."}
