This conjecture, which we call the Generalized Elliott-Halberstam Conjecture for Shifted Convolutions (GEH-2), provides a level of distribution for correlations of the von Mangoldt function. We show that GEH-2 implies the twin prime conjecture, describe heuristic and analytic motivation, and discuss implications for prime gaps and $k$-tuple patterns."}

Unlike previous generalizations, it has three rather than two terms, and involves not just one, but two distinct triangular numbers, and each term is of degree $4$ in $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. The asymptotic behavior for large $n$ leads to continued fractions with remarkable (but conjectural) properties. Moreover, we give a way of looking at squares of triangular numbers that involves the square root of $11$ and show it is a limiting case of a non-obvious identity involving truncations of the continued fraction expansion of that square root. The details involve a nonlinear recurrence that (with appropriate initial conditions) unexpectedly produces only integers, a ``Somos-type'' phenomenon."}

Garvan of Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to the cubic base. In 2013, D. Schultz discovered an identity for theta series in three variables which generalizes the Borweins' identity. In this article, we revisit Schultz's identity and present two distinct approaches to its derivation. Our investigation not only provides new proofs but also yields several identities of a similar type. Furthermore, this study enables us to construct new two-variable generalizations of Jacobi's original classical identity."}

For example, if $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\\ge q > 1,~k \\ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\\sum_{n=1}^N \\cos(2πn_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $σ$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\\cos(2 πx)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\\ell= c$, where $1\\leq k,\\ell \\leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \\le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\\mathbb{P} \\left[\\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) > t \\|f\\|_2 \\sqrt{N} \\right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\\sqrt{2 \\log g_N}$. We also show that this criterion is optimal in the sense that under the same premises, the conclusion can fail to be true for values of $t$ beyond this threshold."}
