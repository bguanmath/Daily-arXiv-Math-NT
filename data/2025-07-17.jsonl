Less is known\nabout the case when $k\\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to\nthe $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered\" structure\non each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special\ncases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are\nadded.

There are (at least) two ways to approach these\ncategories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths\nand weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their\nstructure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a\ncertain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious.\nFurthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same\ncategories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures\non the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct\ncategories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our\nresults rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite\ngeometry."}
