Abstract: A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$
for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called
square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number
$d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in
one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples
$(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product
$\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$
and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4.
Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if
$\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular
numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist
infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials
$j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations:
$k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1)
[b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 =
k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1}
k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer
$\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots,
\ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that
the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all
quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive
integers with equal sums of squares.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of the positive divisors of $n$. A positive
integer $n$ is said to be $2$-near perfect when $\sigma(n)=2n+d_1+d_2$, where
$d_1$ and $d_2$ are distinct positive divisors of $n$. We show that there are
no odd $2$-near perfect numbers with exactly two prime factors, and that all
even $2$-near perfect numbers (i.e. those of the form $2^kp^m$, where $p$ is an
odd prime) belong to a specific family, provided that $m$ is at least 3. In
combination with prior work, these results produce a complete characterization
of $2$-near perfect numbers with exactly 2 prime factors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: By applying interpretable machine learning methods such as decision trees, we
study how simple models can classify the Galois groups of Galois extensions
over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degrees 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10, using Dedekind zeta
coefficients. Our interpretation of the machine learning results allows us to
understand how the distribution of zeta coefficients depends on the Galois
group, and to prove new criteria for classifying the Galois groups of these
extensions. Combined with previous results, this work provides another example
of a new paradigm in mathematical research driven by machine learning.

### [4] [Superior Highly Composite Numbers and the Explicit Upper Bound of Generalized Divisor Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06764)
*Lee-Peng Teo*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper derives and computes the maximum values and corresponding integers for a specific function involving superior $k$-highly composite numbers for $2\leq k\leq 100$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding the properties and behavior of superior $k$-highly composite numbers, particularly how they maximize a defined function involving the number of divisors and logarithmic terms.

Method: The paper analyzes the function $f_k(n)$, identifies its maximum value $\lambda(k)$ at a superior $k$-highly composite number, and then devises an efficient algorithm to calculate $\lambda(k)$ and $N_{\max}(k)$. Computational results are generated for $2\leq k\leq 100$.

Result: The results include the computation of $\lambda(k)$ and $N_{\max}(k)$ for all $k$ from 2 to 100, which are presented in a table for reference.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that superior $k$-highly composite numbers play a critical role in maximizing the function $f_k(n)$ and provides a toolkit (algorithm) for efficiently determining these values for any $k\geq 2$.

Abstract: For $k\geq 2$, we give a detailed exposition of the superior $k$-highly
composite numbers. We then consider the function \[f_k(n)=\frac{\log
d_k(n)\log\log n}{\log k\log n},\quad n\geq 3\] which has a maximum value
$\lambda(k)$ at a superior $k$-highly composite number. We develop an efficient
algorithm to compute $\lambda(k)$ and the positive integer $N_{\max}(k)$ where
$f_k$ achieves the value $\lambda(k)$. The results for $2\leq k\leq 100$ are
tabled.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A well-known problem in the theory of polynomials over finite fields is the
characterization of minimal value set polynomials (MVSPs) over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q = p^n$. These are the nonconstant polynomials $F \in
\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ whose value set $V_F = \{F(a) : a \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$ has the
smallest possible size, namely $\lceil \frac{q}{\deg(F)} \rceil$. In this
paper, we describe the family $\mathcal{A}_q$ of all subsets $S \subseteq
\mathbb{F}_q$ with $\# S>2$ that can be realized as the value set of an MVSP $F
\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$. Affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$ are a fundamental type
of set in $\mathcal{A}_q$, and we provide the complete list of all MVSPs with
such value sets. Building on this, we present a conjecture that characterizes
all MVSPs $F \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ with $V_F=S$ for any $S \in \mathcal{A}_q$.
The conjecture is confirmed by prior results for $q \in\left\{p, p^2,
p^3\right\}$ or $\# S \geq p^{n / 2}$, and additional instances, including the
cases for $q=p^4$ and $\# S>p^{n / 2-1}$, are proved. We further show that the
conjecture leads to the complete characterization of the
$\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical curves of type $y^d=f(x)$, which we
establish as a theorem for $q=p^4$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We continue to work on \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} for $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over
$\mathbb{Q}$ with ramification at $S = \{\infty, q_1, \dots, q_r\}$ (where $2
\in S$), generalizing the final step of Altu\u{g}'s work in the unramified
setting. We derive an explicit asymptotic formula for the elliptic part when
summing over $n<X$ with arbitrary smooth test functions at places in $S$ for
the standard representation. As a consequence, we obtain the desired limit for
the simple trace formula which only occurs in the ramified case. Moreover, we
prove an asymptotic formula for the traces of Hecke operators on cusp forms
with arbitrary level and weight $>2$, directly generalizing Altu\u{g}'s final
result. Our approach differs entirely from Altu\u{g}'s: We apply a second
Poisson summation with respect to the determinant, obtaining a formula on the
Hitchin-Steinberg base $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$. By changing variables
from $(T, N)$ to $(T, \Delta)$ on $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$, we perform
analysis in the new coordinates.

Abstract: In this note we give formulas for cup product in Tate cohomology in terms of

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The generalized Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture, proposed by Wac\l{}aw
Sierpi\'{n}ski in 1956, asks whether the Diophantine equation \[ \frac{5}{a} =
\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \] admits positive integer solutions
$b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}$ for every integer $a \ge 2$. In this work we present
explicit solutions for all integers $a \ge 2$. We begin with the simplest known
cases where $a \equiv i \pmod{5}$ for $i \in \{0,2,3,4\}$, providing direct
decompositions. The remaining open case, $a \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, is addressed
for $a = 5q + 1$ with $q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{252}$, where we give explicit
decompositions, often with $q$ expressed as three-variable polynomials. For $q
\equiv 0 \pmod{252}$, we conjecture that a specific polynomial $p_{1}(x,y,z)=z
(x (5 y-1)-y)-x,~ x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}^*$, which exactly satisfies the
generalized Erd\H{o}s--Straus equation, generates all such multiples of $252$.
This conjecture has been verified computationally for $5q+1$ up to
approximately $10^{10}$, and the corresponding \textit{Mathematica}
implementation is included.

Abstract: We revisit the theory of Ihara $L$-functions in the context initially studied
by Bass and Hashimoto and more recently by Zakharov. In particular, we study if
the Artin formalism is satisfied by these $L$-functions. As an application, we
give a proof of the analogue of Iwasawa's asymptotic class number formula for
the $p$-part of the number of spanning trees in branched
$\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-towers of finite connected graphs using Ihara zeta and
$L$-functions. Moreover, we relate a generator for the characteristic ideal of
the finitely generated torsion Iwasawa module that governs the growth of the
$p$-part of the number of spanning trees in such towers with Ihara
$L$-functions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture, proposed in 1948 by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ernst
G. Straus, asks whether the Diophantine equation \[ \frac{4}{a} = \frac{1}{b} +
\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \] admits positive integer solutions $b, c, d \in
\mathbb{N}^*$ for every integer $a \geq 2$. While the conjecture has been
confirmed for all even integers and for all integers congruent to $3 \pmod{4}$,
the case $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ remains the central open challenge. In this
work, we construct four explicit unbounded multivariable polynomials
$p_1(x,y,z), p_2(x,y,z), p_3(x,y,z), p_4(x,y,z)$ with $x, y, z \geq 1$, such
that each of the first three -- when inserted into the form $a = 4p_i(x,y,z)+1$
-- always produces values of $a$ for which the Erd\H{o}s--Straus equation
admits an explicit solution. Thus, the first three polynomials individually
satisfy the conjecture for all their outputs. We further conjecture that the
values \[ 4p_1(x,y,z)+1,\quad 4p_2(x,y,z)+1,\quad 4p_3(x,y,z)+1,\quad
4p_4(x,y,z)+1 \] collectively cover all integers congruent to $1 \pmod{4}$.
Extensive computational verification up to $q = 10^9$ confirms that every
integer of the form $4q+1$ within this range arises from at least one of these
families. One of the polynomials alone generates all such prime values up to at
least $1.2 \times 10^{10}$. These results offer strong computational evidence
and explicit constructions relevant to the resolution of the conjecture.

### [11] [A note on arithmetic congruences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07478)
*Nic Fellini*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the p-adic L-function of a real quadratic field and proves a special type of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla congruence for prime power modulus; it also demonstrates classical congruences related to Bernoulli numbers and Wilson quotients within the p-adic Riemann zeta function framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation involves studying congruences in number theory through p-adic L-functions, aiming to understand relationships between Bernoulli numbers and Wilson quotients in the context of real quadratic fields.

Method: The method includes examining the coefficients in the power series of the Kubota--Leopoldt p-adic L-function associated with a non-trivial character of a real quadratic field to establish the congruence and linking classical congruences to the p-adic zeta function theory.

Result: The paper achieves a proof of a new congruence of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla-type for prime power modulus and demonstrates the integration of Bernoulli and Wilson quotient congruences into the p-adic zeta function theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the successful application of coefficient analysis in p-adic L-functions to derive congruences, offering deeper insights into p-adic methods and classical number theory within the context of real quadratic fields.

Abstract: By analyzing the coefficients of the power series defining the
Kubota--Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-function associated to the non-trivial character
of a real quadratic field, we prove a congruence of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla-type
for prime power modulus. Additionally, we show how some classical congruences
relating Bernoulli numbers and Wilson quotients fit naturally into the theory
of the $p$-adic Riemann zeta function.

Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field and let $\pi \colon X \rightarrow\mathbb{P}_k^1$ be
a smooth conic bundle. We show that if $X/k$ has four geometric singular fibers
and either $X(\mathbb{A}_k)\neq \emptyset$ or $X/k$ has non-trivial Brauer
group, then $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over any even degree extension
$L/k$. Furthermore for arbitrary $X$ we show that, conditional on Schinzel's
hypothesis, $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over all but finitely many
quadratic extensions of $k$. We prove these results by showing the Brauer-Manin
obstruction vanishes and then apply fibration method results of
Colliot-Th\'el\`ene, following Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as
analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility
that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two
insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi\l\l's proof of quantum
unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via
Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This
observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of
certain arithmetic problems.
  Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of
$L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families. Under the
assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we prove upper
bound estimates for their moments and present the following three arithmetic
applications:
  i) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over imaginary quadratic
fields.
  ii) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular
forms.
  iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of
Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under quadratic twists.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of finding two sets of integers,
$\{a_1, a_2, \ldots$, $a_m\}$ and $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}$, such that all
the $mn$ sums $a_i+b_j, i=1, \ldots, m, j=1, \ldots, n$, are perfect squares. A
method is known for generating numerical examples of such sets when $m=2$ or 3
and $n$ is arbitrary. When both $m$ and $n$ exceed 2, only one two-parameter
solution with $(m, n)=(4, 4)$ has been published. In this paper we obtain
several multi-parameter solutions of the problem in three cases when $(m, n)$
is $(3, 3)$ or $(5, 3)$ or $(4, 4)$, and we indicate how more such solutions
may be obtained.

Abstract: The P\'{o}lya group $Po(K)$ of an algebraic number field $K$ is the subgroup
of the ideal class group $Cl_{K}$ generated by the ideal classes of the
products of prime ideals of the same norm. If $Po(K)$ is trivial, then the
number field $K$ is said to be a P\'{o}lya field. In this article, we furnish
three families $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{qrs})$,
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{qrs})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{2qrs})$ of
bi-quadratic P\'{o}lya fields $K$ involving prime numbers $p,q,r$ and $s$ that
satisfy certain quadratic residue conditions. It is worthwhile to note that in
each of the fields, exactly five primes ramify in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ and this is
the maximum possible number of ramified primes in a P\'{o}lya field over
$\mathbb{Q}$. Towards the end of the paper, we discuss about large P\'{o}lya
groups of the compositums of Shank's cubic fields and Lehmer's quintic fields
and prove that there are infinitely many such fields with index $1$.

Abstract: A positive definite and integral quadratic form $f$ is called irrecoverable
if there is a quadratic form $F$ such that it represents all proper subforms of
$f$, whereas it does not represent $f$ itself. In this case, $F$ is called an
isolation of $f$. In this article, we prove that there does not exist a binary
isolation of any unary quadratic form. We also prove that there does not exist

class group of a primitive binary quadratic form has no element of order $4$,
then the discriminant of any quaternary isolation of it, if exists, is a square
of an integer. The composition laws of primitive binary quadratic forms play an
essential role in the proofs of the results.

Abstract: In this work, we show that given a finite p-group G, a number field K having
a trivial p-class group Cl K , and a finite set of primes S of K, there exists
a finite extension F/K such that the S-split p-Hilbert class field tower L S p
(F ) of F has G as its Galois group. This extends results by Ozaki and

Abstract: The sequences of $\operatorname{SL}(2,{\mathbb N})$-saturated Farey fractions
were defined in our previous work as ${\mathscr S}_Q := \{ a/q \in {\mathbb Q}
\cap (0,1]: q+a+\bar{a} \le Q\}$, where $\bar{a}$ is the multiplicative inverse
of $a\pmod{q}$ in $[1,q)$. Here, we prove that the set of $Q$-scaled
denominators of consecutive fractions in ${\mathscr S}_Q$ is dense in the
region ${\mathcal V}:=\{ (x,y)\in [0,1]^2 : \max \{ (1-3x)/2,2x-1\} \le y \le
\max \{ x,1-x\} \}$, and provide a formula for their distribution in ${\mathcal
V}$ as $Q\rightarrow \infty$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful
in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in
dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further.
The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree
up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in
any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential
growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of
non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound,
for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal
polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in
$\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results
on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting
Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give
a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary
proof which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: A subset $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}$ is called $s$-almost square
universal if every sufficiently large positive integer can be written as a sum
of at most $s$ squares of integers from $\mathcal{A}$. In this article, we
study the minimal number $\mathrm{ASU}(\mathcal{A}_{d,m})$ with this property,
where $\mathcal{A}_{d,m}$ denotes the residue class of $d$ modulo $m$, with
$m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d\in\mathbb{Z}$. We further prove that
$\mathcal{A}_{d,m}$ is $s$-square universal for some $s\in\mathbb{N}$ if and
only if $d \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{m}$, and determine the minimal such number
$\mathrm{SU}(\mathcal{A}_{d,m})$ in these cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct $p$-adic $L$-functions for regularly refined cuspidal
automorphic representations of symplectic type on $\operatorname{GL}_{2n}$ over
totally real fields, which are parahoric spherical at every finite place.
Furthermore, we prove etaleness of the parabolic eigenvariety at such points
and construct $p$-adic $L$-functions in families. The novel local ingredients
are the construction of improved Ash--Ginzburg Shalika functionals and
production of Friedberg--Jacquet test vectors relating local zeta integrals to
automorphic $L$-functions beyond the spherical level. Our proofs rely on a
generalization of Shahidi's theory of local coefficients to Shalika models, for
which we establish a general factorization formula related to the exterior
square automorphic $L$-function.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $k$ a characteristic-$p$ field, and $\pi$ be a
simple $k[G]$-module. We show that if $\pi$ is in a $p$-nilpotent block with
cyclic defect group, then $\pi$ appears with multiplicity at most one in the
socle and cosocle of induced $k[G]$-modules that are multiplicity-free in
characteristic zero and satisfy some additional hypotheses. We show that this
applies, in particular, to certain Deligne--Lusztig modules $\pi$. As an
application, we prove that well-known character formulas for cuspidal
representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$ have modular analogs as
statements about short exact sequences of lattices. We also prove modular
analogs of character formulas for representations coming from higher-depth
supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$. The appendix by the authors
and R. Zhang is an erratum to ``Modular Gelfand pairs and multiplicity-free
representations'' by R. Zhang, which states some multiplicity-freeness results
in overly broad generality; we provide counterexamples and partial corrections
to these claims.

Abstract: Using spectral flow, we provide a proof of [9, Theorem 9.17] on unitarity of
Ramond twisted non-extremal representations of minimal $W$-algebras that does
not rely on the still conjectural exactness of the twisted quantum reduction
functor (see Conjecture 9.11 of [9]). When $\mathfrak g=spo(2|2n)$, $F(4)$,
$D(2,1;\frac{m}{n})$, it is also proven that the unitarity of extremal
(=massless) representations of the minimal $W$-algebra $W^k_{\min}(\mathfrak
g)$ in the Ramond sector is equivalent to the unitarity of extremal
representations in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.

Abstract: This paper investigates the Auslander-Gorenstein property for monomial
algebras. First, we prove that every Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebra is a
string algebra and present a simple combinatorial classification of
Auslander-Gorenstein gentle algebras. Furthermore, we describe a procedure to
transform any 2-Gorenstein monomial algebra into a Nakayama algebra, thereby
reducing the classification of Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebras to that
of Auslander-Gorenstein Nakayama algebras. As an application of this reduction
method, we prove that every monomial algebra satisfies a stronger version of
the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture.
  Our second main result establishes that a monomial algebra is
Auslander-Gorenstein if and only if it has a well-defined, bijective
Auslander-Reiten map, confirming a conjecture of Marczinzik for monomial
algebras. This yields a new homological characterisation of the
Auslander-Gorenstein property. Additionally, we provide an explicit description
of the Auslander-Reiten bijection in the case of gentle algebras. Along the
way, we also generalise a result of Iwanaga and Fuller: We show that every
$2n$-Gorenstein monomial algebra is also $(2n+1)$-Gorenstein for every $n\ge
1.$

Abstract: This is an extended abstract of our work "Level-Rank Dualities from
$\Phi$-Cuspidal Pairs..." We present evidence for a family of surprising
coincidences within the representation theory of a finite reductive group $G$:
more precisely, dualities between blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras attached
by Brou\'e-Malle to $\Phi$-cuspidal pairs of $G$, where the Hecke parameters
are specialized not to the order of the underlying finite field, but to roots
of unity. For the groups $G = \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F}_q)$, these coincidences
can be expressed very concretely in terms of the combinatorics of partitions,
and the whole story recovers an avatar of the level-rank duality studied by
Frenkel, Uglov, Chuang-Miyachi, and others.

Abstract: We study the relation between representations of certain infinite-dimensional
Lie groups and those of the associated conformal nets. For a chiral conformal
net extending the net generated by the vacuum representation of a loop group or
diffeomorphism group of the circle, we show that any conformal net
representation induces a positive-energy representation of the corresponding
group. Consequently, we prove that any representation of such a conformal net
is automatically diffeomorphism covariant. Moreover, we show that the
covariance cocycles of conformal net representations satisfy naturality with
respect to the action of diffeomorphisms, i.e. the diffeomorphisms act
equivariantly on the category of conformal net representations.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$. We
examine the Lefschetz homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$
from the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded
homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, to
the orthogonal unit group of the Grothendieck group of
$K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, i.e. the trivial source ring. When $p = 2$ and $k
= \mathbb{F}_2$, $\Lambda$ is surjective when $G$ has a Sylow $2$-subgroup with
fusion controlled by its normalizer, and when $G$ has dihedral Sylow
$2$-subgroups. When $p$ is odd, $\Lambda$ is surjective if $G$ has a cyclic
Sylow $p$-subgroup or is $p$-nilpotent, but we exhibit examples of groups of
$p$-rank 2 or greater for which $\Lambda$ is not surjective. We also examine
the kernel of the Lefschetz homomorphism, determining it for all groups when $p
= 2$ and for groups with cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroups when $p$ is odd.

Abstract: A rooted tree module (RTM) $M:=M(T,F)$ over a zero-relation algebra
$\Lambda:=\mathcal KQ/\langle\rho\rangle$ over a field $\mathcal K$ is given by
the data of a quiver morphism $F:T\to Q$ from a rooted tree $T$ (either with a
source or a sink) taking paths in $T$ to paths in $Q$ not lying in
$\langle\rho\rangle$. When $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, we provide a
checkable combinatorial characterization of the indecomposability of the RTM
$M$ in terms of non-existence of idempotent quiver morphisms $\iota:T\to T$
satisfying $F\circ\iota=F$ and $\iota\neq 1_T$. Further, we provide an
iterative method to decompose an RTM into indecomposable RTMs as well as a
method to recursively construct indecomposable RTMs.
