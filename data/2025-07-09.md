Abstract: This paper contains two theorems concerning the vanishing of natural
transformations of (co)homology functors. Precisely, assume that $R$ is a right
noetherian ring and $f: M\rt N$ is a morphism of finitely generated right
$R$-modules. The first theorem proves that the natural transformation
$\Ext^1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of finitely generated right
$R$-modules if and only if $\Tor_1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of
finitely generated left $R$-modules. As a corollary of this result, we
establish that $\Ext^1(f, -)$ is epic if and only if $\Tor_1(f, -)$ is monic.
The second theorem shows that if $R$ is left and right noetherian and $M, N$
are Gorenstein projective, then the natural transformations $\Tor_1(f, -)$,
$\Ext^1(-, f)$ and $\Ext^1(f, -)$ vanish over the category of finitely
generated Gorenstein projective modules, simultaneously. This, in particular,
yields that over Gorenstein projective modules, the notions of phantom
morphisms and $\Ext$-phantom morphisms coincide. Also, it is proved that if $R$
is $n$-Gorenstein, then for any integer $i>n$, the natural transformations
$\Ext^{i}(f, -)$, $\Ext^{i}(-, f)$ and $\Tor_{i}(f, -)$ vanish over finitely
generated modules, simultaneously. As an interesting consequence, we show that
under the same assumptions, $\Ext^i(-, f)$ is epic (resp. monic) if and only if
$\Ext^i(f, -)$ is monic (resp. epic) if and only if $\Tor_i(f, -)$ is epic
(resp. monic).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We extend the analysis of Balmer and Gallauer on the tt-geometry of the small
derived category of permutation modules for a finite group over a field to the
setting of a commutative Noetherian base. In this general context, we provide a
description of the tt-spectrum as a set and reduce the study of its topology to
the elementary abelian case. Under certain mild additional assumptions on the
ground ring, we further develop their theory of twisted cohomology, which
enables us to realize the tt-spectrum as a Dirac scheme when restricted to
elementary abelian $p$-groups.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The combinatorics of i-boxes has recently been introduced by
Kashiwara--Kim--Oh--Park in the study of cluster algebras arising from the
representation theory of quantum affine algebras. In this article, we associate
to each chain of i-boxes a signed word, which canonically determines a cluster
seed following Berenstein--Fomin--Zelevinsky. By bridging these two different
languages, we are able to provide a quick solution to the problem of explicit
determining the exchange matrices associated with chains of i-boxes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct Fourier transforms relating functions and distributions on
finite height $p$-divisible rigid analytic groups and objects in a dual
category of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-local systems with analyticity conditions. Our
Fourier transforms are formulated as isomorphisms of solid Hopf algebras over
arbitrary small v-stacks, and generalize earlier constructions of Amice and
Schneider--Teitelbaum. We also construct compatible integral Fourier transforms
for $p$-divisible groups and their dual Tate modules. As an application, we use
the Weierstrass $\wp$-function to construct a global Eisenstein measure over
the $p$-adic modular curve, extending previous constructions of Katz over the
ordinary locus and at CM points, and show its generic fiber, the global
Eisenstein distribution, gives rise to new families of quaternionic modular
forms that overconverge from profinite sets in the rigid analytic supersingular
locus.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Following Cornelissen, Li, Marcolli, and Smit, this short paper proves that
the isomorphism of the Deligne-Ribet monoids $DR_K, DR_L$ for two number fields
$K, L$ implies the field isomorphism of $K$ and $L$. Thus the Deligne-Ribet
monoid $DR_K$ gives a complete invariant of the number field $K$ as in the case
of the absolute Galois group $G_K$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is known on the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis that there are precisely
$13$ cyclic cubic fields that are norm-Euclidean. Unconditionally, there is a
gap between analytic estimates which hold for all sufficiently large conductors
and computational techniques. In this paper, we establish new results
concerning explicit bounds for cubic non-residues and refine previous
computational techniques, enabling us to completely characterise all
norm-Euclidean cyclic cubic fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compute the first and second moment formulas for Siegel transforms related
to problems counting primitive lattice points in the real plane with congruence
conditions. As applications, we derive an analog of Schmidt's random counting
theorem and the quantitative Khintchine theorem for irrational numbers,
approximated by rational numbers $p/q$, where we place a congruence-conditional
constraint on the vector $(p,q)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest on distributions of shapes of unit
lattices in number fields, due to both their applications to number theory and
the lack of known results.
  In this work we focus on $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$; such
fields have a rank $2$ unit group. Viewing the unit lattice as a point of
$GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$, we prove that every lattice which
arises this way must correspond to a transcendental point on the boundary of a
certain fundamental domain of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$.
Moreover, we produce three explicit (algebraic) points of
$GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ which are limit points of the set of
(points associated to) unit lattices of $D_4$-quartic fields with signature
$(2,1)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $A$ be an expanding $2 \times 2$ matrix with rational entries and
$\mathbb{Z}^2[A]$ be the smallest $A$-invariant $\mathbb{Z}$-module containing
$\mathbb{Z}^2$. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}^2[A]$ which
is a complete residue system of $\mathbb{Z}^2[A]/A\mathbb{Z}^2[A]$. The pair
$(A,\mathcal{D})$ is called a {\em digit system} with {\em base} $A$ and {\em
digit set} $\mathcal{D}$. It is well known that every vector $x \in
\mathbb{Z}^2[A]$ can be written uniquely in the form \[ x = d_0 + Ad_1 + \cdots
+ A^kd_k + A^{k+1}p, \] with $k\in \mathbb{N}$ minimal, $d_0,\dots,d_k \in
\mathcal{D}$, and $p$ taken from a finite set of {\em periodic elements}, the
so-called {\em attractor} of $(A,\mathcal{D})$. If $p$ can always be chosen to
be $0$ we say that $(A,\mathcal{D})$ has the {\em finiteness property}.
  In the present paper we introduce finite-state transducer automata which
realize the addition of the vectors $\pm(1,0)^\top$ and $\pm(0,1)^\top$ to a
given vector $x\in \mathbb{Z}^2[A]$ in a number system $(A,\mathcal{D})$ with
collinear digit set. These automata are applied to characterize all pairs
$(A,\mathcal{D})$ that have the finiteness property and, more generally, to
characterize the attractors of these digit systems.
