Wooley's 60th birthday volume", "summary": "In this paper we prove a correspondence between a canonical degree six\ncovariant of binary quartic forms $F$ and a cubic covariant of a pair of\nternary quadratic forms $(f_A, f_B)$. In the process we obtain a canonical way\nto diagonalize a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over any field $K$ of\ncharacteristic zero. As a corollary, we give a precise criterion to decide\nwhether a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is diagonalizable\nover $\\mathbb{Q}$."}

In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve\nstudied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical\nsetting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the\nextreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward\none-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate\nbiases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we\nextend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races)\nand precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they\ntend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result\nis an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\\ge$ 2),\ngeneralizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way\nexpression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the\nsame hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing\ncompletely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\\ge$ 3\nthis criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We\nalso construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove\ndensity results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different\nbehaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\\ge$ 4. and showed\nthat its magnitude governs the bias: 2 ) converges to the extreme values 1 or\n0. $\\bullet$ Moderate bias.

Applying this criterion to several explicit families such that\nthe degree grows to $\\infty$, Fiorilli and Jouve produced examples of both\nmoderate and extreme biases along families of number fields. In the same\nspirit, Bailleul [1] investigated dihedral and quaternion extensions,\nuncovering further families in which the densities not only approach the value\n1/2 but can again be made to lie arbitrarily near the extremes, while also\nhighlighting the influence of central zeros of Artin L-functions on the\nbehavior of those densities."}
